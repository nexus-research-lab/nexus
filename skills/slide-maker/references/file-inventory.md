**Scripts** (`scripts/`):
- `deckkit.py` — the build helpers (template & blank decks), **incl. the editable native charts**
  (`native_chart`/`native_dual_axis`/`native_donut`/`native_pareto`/`native_bubble` — click-to-edit,
  any-language-safe) **and the build-time geometry gate** (`lint_layout(prs, strict=True)` — run before `prs.save()`;
  the in-process pre-render net for overflow/off-canvas/text-overlap/card-escape/footer/off-centre — plus
  `fit_text_size`); the build's source of truth. Full signatures in its docstrings.
- `component_audit.py` — did this deck hand-roll a form the library already implements? Reads the
  build script (every import form: `dk.x()`, an alias, or `from deckkit import x`) + the finished
  pptx (geometry signatures: bar rows, abutting 100% bands, tile rows, marker rows) and names the
  component whose guarantee the hand-roll gave up. **Advisory, never a blocker** — a bespoke
  composition is the signature move; what the tool states as fact is the usage ratio and the specific
  match. Reporting is suppressed when the deck draws with a FORM component that emits the same
  geometry (a component's own output must never be reported as a hand-roll); that set is **derived
  from deckkit's source and intersected with the form catalogue** — it has been wrong twice as a
  hand-kept list, and a primitive in it would silence the tool forever. Exits 1 and prints
  `NOT CHECKED` rather than reporting clean when the deck could not be opened. ~50ms. Run it at
  PRE-FLIGHT 12.
- `directions_diversity.py` — mechanical divergence check for direction-gate candidates
  (mode · palette distance · type pairing · composition), flagging any pair that matches on ≥3 of 4
  axes. Exit 0 all diverge / 2 flagged / 1 unreadable. Never auto-kills: a flag means REDIVERGE **or**
  record a named justification on the `direction gate:` line. Run it before posting the preview link.
- `render_deck.py` — pptx → one PNG per slide (verify + critic loop). **`--slides N[,M]` renders ONLY
  the named 1-indexed pages** — the Step-4 SIGNATURE PROOF and any "re-render just the page I edited"
  loop; byte-identical to those pages from a full render, and it deliberately leaves NO cache (a cache
  would claim every page is current). Mutually exclusive with `--fast` (which chooses the set for you)
  and with `--deliverables` (which needs the whole deck). **`--fast` re-renders only the
  slides whose content changed since the last run** (per-slide fingerprint + deck-global digest,
  cached in `render/.render-cache.json`; subsets the pptx, output byte-identical to a full render,
  auto-falls-back to full whenever the page mapping could be wrong) — ~12s → ~4.7s for a one-slide
  edit, 0.07s when nothing changed. **`--deliverables` (alias
  `--final`) additionally parks the PDF beside the pptx and writes `viewer.html`, a zero-dependency
  flip-through preview** — off by default, so an in-progress deck never accumulates stale copies;
  run it at hand-off once the user confirms the deck is final (PNGs always stay in `render/`); finds LibreOffice cross-platform
  or set `SOFFICE` (`.sh` is a shim). `check_env.py` — preflight if a render fails. `inspect_template.py`
  — a template's layouts/placeholders/logos. `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `lint_deck.py` — deterministic **render-time** layout lint and complement to deckkit's build-time
  `lint_layout`: re-checks geometry on the final file (off-slide overflow · block/image collision
  [containment excluded] · footer-zone intrusion · text-past-card · uneven rows) AND adds the
  render/parse-only faults (CJK kinsoku/widow · whole-page-image · orphan slides — plus missing EA font as the render-time BACKSTOP; `lint_layout` now catches it at build time as `CJK_NO_EA`);
  run after render, before critic; non-zero on findings.
- `plan_wordcount.py` — advisory per-slide word-budget pass over the Content plan's table (the Step-1
  comprehension-gate check; write the table to a scratch path, never the deliverable folder).
  `validate_review.py` — stdlib schema validator for critic/arbiter JSON (`critic|arbiter <file|->`;
  Step 5 runs it before acting on any review).
- `anim.py` — PowerPoint click-builds/transitions (pair `references/animation.md`).
- `formats.py` — named canvas-format registry (16:9 default · 4:3 · square 1:1 · 小红书 3:4 · story
  9:16 · A4 print): dimensions, platform safe zones, chrome policy, density + lint flags, and the
  `band()` safe-rect helper; opt-in — the 16:9 default never touches it (pair `references/canvas-formats.md`).
- `designed_charts.py` — raster matplotlib chart recipes (dumbbell, slope, dual_axis, bubble_trend,
  pareto, donut_kpi, **waterfall** — for a chart type with no native equivalent or a deliberate look;
  prefer deckkit's native charts; `references/data-viz.md`). `maps.py` — **choropleth base maps**
  (europe · world · china provinces) from public-domain geometry, value-shaded → PNG placed by
  `deckkit.choropleth()` (which adds the native title + legend); `references/data-viz.md`. `presets.py` — named
  design-language presets (glassmorphism · swiss · editorial_paper · editorial_report · risograph ·
  memphis · brutalist · blueprint · ink_wash · eastern_traditional · **consulting** (MBB action-title) ·
  **dark_tech** (engineering dark + diagram-island) · **luxury_dark** · **museum_memorial** ·
  **bauhaus** · **midcentury** · **terminal** · **synthwave** — **18 total**; ink_wash/
  eastern_traditional → `references/east-asian-aesthetic.md`; the full style+component catalogue →
  `references/design-gallery.md`).
- `image_prompts.py` (build the prompt manifest) → `generate_images_codex.py` (no-key, Codex CLI) /
  `generate_images_openai.py` (**metered** API path — gated, see the BILLING GATE). `archetypes_html.py` (direction-gate previews as
  **one HTML link** — `preset_directions([names])` turns best-fit preset names into direction tokens
  carrying each preset's real DNA, so the options are STYLES not colour schemes (accepts a **dict** in
  the list for the no-image-tool gate's 4th pure colour-scheme direction); `_dna_cover` renders each
  preset's signature hero motif and `_dna_ambient` runs the quiet register signature on EVERY interior
  preview slide so the style carries all pages, not just the cover; `archetypes.py` is the older
  pptx-render variant + the post-pick one-slide fidelity confirm) · `assemble.py` (assemble a sectioned deck) · `export_notes.py` (notes →
  rehearsal script).
- `icons.py` — fetch an open-licensed SVG icon (Tabler/Lucide/Phosphor incl. **6 weights + duotone**/
  Simple…), recolor OR **gradient-fill** to the deck palette, rasterize to a transparent PNG
  (`icon_png(spec, out, color=…, gradient=(c0,c1), px)`); pair with the deckkit container helpers
  `icon` / `icon_tile` (solid/gradient/glass tile) / `icon_badge` (ring) / `icon_ghost` (watermark) /
  `icon_card`. See `references/icons.md` ("Treatments").
- `image_fx.py` — `duotone(img, ink_a, ink_b)` / `grayscale(img)` — preprocess a colour photo to the
  deck's ink so it doesn't fight the accent (riso/brutalist/ink/luxury/museum). See `design-gallery.md`.
- `extract_pdf.py` (crop a figure from a PDF — `figures`/`figure`/`autofig` auto-detect, `page`/`crop`
  manual; **plus the long-source trio `map` (TOC + CJK-aware word-density skeleton), `text` (page-range
  dump for chunked reading), and `headings` (reconstruct a skeleton for a no-TOC book)** — the tooling
  for the content-planner's long-source mode) · `crop_helper.py`
  (crop/trim/panel **by looking, not guessing**) · `extract_deck.py` (pull content out of an existing
  deck — the redesign path) · `ingest.py` (ingest a NON-PDF source — `doctext`/`office` for Word/Office,
  `frames` for a video's visual track, `probe` to route — with the vision/audio fidelity floor).
**Agents** (`agents/`): `content-planner.md` (Step-1 CONTENT deep-understand + claim ledger + per-slide message; the content checkpoint) · `slide-design.md` (the art director — Step-2 design language + per-slide form/layout/rhythm + icons + appear-animation + the Form ledger; the design checkpoint) · `critic.md` (independent critic brief — the two review lenses + JSON schema) · `arbiter.md` (high-stakes finding cross-validation + fix-verification; no-op low-stakes) · `asset-prep.md` (execution-only asset materializer — crops/equations/plates/icons after the design plan is approved; zero design decisions).

**References** (`references/`, loaded on demand): `canvas-formats.md` (per-surface layout DNA for the non-16:9 formats — square/rednote/story/A4 — + the repurpose/batch pattern; pairs `scripts/formats.py`) · `design-principles.md` (the craft / the "why"; incl. the **C.R.A.P. framework** — Contrast · Repetition · Alignment · Proximity) · `design-gallery.md` (style+component catalogue mined from 21 pro decks — pick a preset, reach for the right component) · `semantic-color-contract.md` (bind a hue to a concept deck-wide) · `review-rubrics.md` (universal + per-purpose review criteria) · `design-by-purpose.md` (per-purpose look for "design a clean one") · `form-selection.md` (**content-shape → candidate FORMS** — the single design-decision map; generate a set, pick deliberately) · `schematic-diagrams.md` (**HOW to draw a labelled SCIENCE schematic** — force/ray/circuit/apparatus/vector/wave; matplotlib/domain-lib recipes for precise/label-critical ones, OR the image tool for complex/stylized/template-matched ones with labels overlaid native; + the domain-accuracy fidelity gate) · `data-viz.md` (pick the chart type; editable-native vs raster) · `image-generation.md` (when/how; topical, text-free, consistently placed) · `icons.md` (one coherent open-licensed icon family, recolored, restrained) · `generated-template.md` (Q1's image-tool template branch) · `style-analysis.md` (mimic a style example, Q4) · `font-guidance.md` (portable fonts, tofu recovery) · `multilingual.md` (non-Latin / CJK / RTL) · `east-asian-aesthetic.md` (Chinese ink / traditional looks — paper · seal · CJK numerals · `ink_wash`/`eastern_traditional`) · `animation.md` (when/why + `anim.py`) · `large-deck-orchestration.md` (section fan-out; default is single-author) · `collaborative-mode.md` (direction→outline→draft gates) · `redesign-existing-deck.md` (diagnose-then-rebuild) · `handoff-and-iteration.md` (delivery + iterate without clobbering edits) · `design-intelligence-addendum.md` (the deck-level design gates Step 2 measures against — rhythm map · block-dependency audit · Concept→Visualization table · semantic-colour ledger · variation floors) · `troubleshooting-faq.md` (**symptom → cause → fix for every error surface** — env · build exceptions · both lints · render · images · CJK — plus the FAQ; consult on any failure, and report findings to the user in its plain-language form) · `user-taste.md` (the registry-root `taste.md` — schema · read protocol · dial-ledger promotion + consented-look write-back) · `examples/` (`build_example_generic.py`, `style_example.py`, `section_example.py`).

**Registry** (NOT part of the skill): `~/.codex/slide-templates/` (Codex) · `~/.claude/slide-templates/` (Claude Code) — the user's saved templates, **plus `taste.md` at the root** (the portable taste profile — schema + read/write protocol in `references/user-taste.md`); read for choices, write new `profile.md`s to the active host — a freshly-designed look saved at hand-off carries the vetted critic `strengths` distilled into its profile's Notes. Empty for a new user (no templates, no `taste.md` — silently skipped; no write until the first durable signal).
| `scripts/contact_sheet.py` | Montage every `slideNN.png` onto ONE image so a critic can survey a whole deck in a single look, then open individual slides at full size only where needed. Narrows the COST of a review round, never its scope. |
