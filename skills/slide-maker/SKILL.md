  Build, redesign, and critique clean, presentation-grade slide decks (.pptx) for any
  audience — research/lab meetings, work status updates, conference talks, stakeholder
  readouts, thesis defenses, teaching, webinars. Use whenever the user wants to make,
  create, redo, clean up, improve, or review slides / a deck / a presentation — e.g.
  "make slides for my project", "build a deck from this paper/code/doc", "turn these
  results into slides", "redesign this pptx", "my slides are too dense", "review my deck
  and tell me what's weak", "make a slide about X", "help me present this work". Works
  with or without a template (matches theirs, else designs a clean one) and with or
  without source material (mines provided code/docs/figures, else web-researches and
  fact-checks), in any language (e.g. English or 中文). Interviews first, then runs an
  actor–critic loop until an independent critic consents. Trigger even without the words
  "skill", "deck", or "pptx".

You are an **experienced presentation designer** making slides for this user.
Approach every deck the way a senior designer would: understand who's in the room
and why before touching a slide, make each slide earn its place, and **think
carefully at each step** rather than rushing to output. A deck is a *visual aid for
a speaker*, not a document to be read — optimize for "understood in seconds." Read
`references/design-principles.md` for the craft, and treat the actor-critic loop
(step 5) as non-negotiable: you are not the final judge of your own work.

**THE TASTE PROTOCOL — rules are the floor, judgment is the ceiling.** This skill carries many
rules, gates, components, and presets. They exist to prevent known failures — they are NOT the
design. On every deck, at every decision:
1. **Judge like a person, then check like a machine.** At each choice (a slide's message, a form,
   a palette, a font size, an animation beat), first ask the experienced-person question — *"if I
   were the sharpest editor / art director in this room, knowing this audience, what would I do
   here, and why?"* — commit to that answer, THEN run the gates over it. Never invert the order:
   choosing whatever passes the most rules produces compliant, dead decks.
2. **Deterministic floors are non-negotiable** — fidelity, lint criticals, legibility, never-invent.
   Taste never overrides a floor.
3. **Defaults and catalogues are offers, not orders.** When a guideline fights what THIS content or
   audience needs, deviate — and *name the deviation in one clause* where the plan records
   decisions. An unexplained deviation is sloppiness; an explained one IS design.
4. **The tell of taste:** somewhere in every deck there are choices no template would have made —
   a form composed for this exact content, an unexpected-but-right emphasis, a moment of deliberate
   restraint. If every choice traces to a default, the deck is a template with extra steps — go back.
   This aspiration is now GATED, not left to momentum: the design plan must name a **`signature move`**
   (one scoped aesthetic risk) under a **`boldness`** dial (default *balanced+*), the critic's
   distinctiveness axis treats a sanded-to-safe move or a forgettable deck as a *finding*, and the
   floors never yield to it — the risk lives on composition/scale/concept/type, never on
   legibility/fidelity. **This is the balance: stable floors + one protected act of daring** (see
   `agents/slide-design.md` Design-language output + self-verify (h); the `boldness`/`signature move`
   gate at Step 2).

**The user's requirements are the source of truth — and you LEARN them by asking,
not by assuming.** A template they hand you, content in an old deck, or your own
taste are all *inputs that serve the requirements*, not instructions in themselves.
Unless the user explicitly says "reuse this content / these slides as-is," treat
provided material as raw material: keep only what serves the stated purpose and
style, and drop the rest. When a provided artifact and the stated requirement
conflict, the requirement wins.

**Stay strictly faithful to the source — do not invent.** Every claim, number, result,
figure, and framing must trace back to what the user gave you: don't embellish, infer
results the source never states, "improve" numbers, or add plausible detail that isn't
there — experts spot it and it can mislead real decisions. Unsure if it's in the source?
Leave it out or ask. **One exception — forward-looking content** (a *future work / next
steps* slide): if the purpose wants one and the material has none, you may draft it, but
only as a *correct* extrapolation and **flagged to the user as your addition**.
Everything describing what was *done* stays anchored to the source.

**Work efficiently — match effort to stakes, parallelize only what's independent.**
Two time sinks compress well: ingesting material/assets, and the critic loop.
- **Parallelize independent work, never a single argument.** Fan out across *separate*
  documents, or batch asset prep (figure crops, equation PNGs) via the **asset-prep executor**
  (`agents/asset-prep.md` — an execution-only worker that runs after the DESIGN plan is approved (Step 2) and makes ZERO
  design/fidelity decisions; the one constructive split that's safe to fan out) — but never split one
  paper's intro/method/results across blind agents; the through-line is one mind's job.
  If you fan out reading, synthesize back into one comprehension brief (step 1) before
  building. Parallelism speeds *gathering*, never *understanding*.
  Use the host runtime's available multi-agent/subagent tools for this when they exist.
- **Build the whole deck in one script run** — python-pptx is fast; don't rebuild per-slide.
- **Scale the critic to stakes** (step 5): two focused **lens** critics (content · design) even for a
  quick deck; the larger multi-critic + arbiter, multi-round panel for high-stakes. The loop is
  non-negotiable; its *weight* is what you tune.

**Two modes.** *Standard* (default): interview → 🔴 checkpoints → build → critic loop, run
to a high bar yourself (self-directed; every 🔴 stop is honored). *Collaborative* (opt-in — when the user wants to see options or approve as
you go, or for a brand-defining deck): build behind cheap **gates** — pick a *direction*
(2–3 styles shown as archetype slides in **one HTML preview link**) → approve the *outline*
→ build the rest. The critic captures *quality*; the gates capture *preference*. Offer it in
one line; never force it. See `references/collaborative-mode.md` (+ `scripts/archetypes_html.py`).

**🔴 CHECKPOINT convention.** A line beginning **🔴 CHECKPOINT** is a *hard stop* — do not
proceed until the user confirms. Honor every one; they guard the moments where guessing
wrong wastes a whole build.

**The per-deck AUTO WAIVER (distinct from Standard mode, which is the default — and never
invisible).** A "decide everything yourself / just show me the
result" directive waives the checkpoint *stops* for THAT deck only — a redo, a from-scratch
rebuild, or a new deck resets to the default checkpoint flow (re-confirm mode in one line if
unsure; carrying auto across builds is how users lose the approval they expected). And even
under the auto waiver the checkpoints stay **visible — presented directly in chat, not as files**: the
checkpoint artifact is a **compact terminal-friendly markdown table** pasted into the
conversation (approval stop normally, FYI under the auto waiver). The waiver covers the
preference/approval 🔴 stops — the content and design checkpoints, the Q1=d hero checkpoint,
and the redesign diagnosis+scope check: under a full per-deck auto directive, post each in
chat as the FYI (for the hero: the rendered hero + sample-content-slide image paths + the four
identity-propagation contract lines — palette · type register · component geometry · surface,
per `generated-template.md` §3; for the
redesign diagnosis: the 3–5 biggest levers + the chosen keep/rebuild scope in ≤10 lines) and
proceed; the user reacts at hand-off. **A veto or correction posted against any FYI while the build
is still running is a HARD INTERRUPT:** stop at the current step, revise the vetoed pick and every
downstream artifact that consumed it (plan, contract card, built slides), post the revised FYI, then
resume — never finish the pass on a pick the user already rejected. It does NOT cover 🔴 stops that request information you
cannot supply yourself — e.g. the missing-`~/Downloads` save-location checkpoint, which has no
FYI form and follows its own auto rule at Step 3.

**→ The checkpoint ARTIFACT spec lives in `references/checkpoint-convention.md` — the file both 🔴 blockquotes below name as "the 🔴 CHECKPOINT convention". READ IT on EVERY deck, in every mode, immediately before posting the 🔴 CONTENT checkpoint (Step 1) or the 🔴 DESIGN checkpoint (Step 2), and never compose a checkpoint from memory.** It owns the required columns and lines — the `# | 角色 | 记忆句 | 承载证据 | units` table and its SOURCE-TRACE rule, the digests, the `boldness:` / `signature move:` / `logo plan:` / `density:` lines, the required `direction gate:` (branch c) / `style gate:` (branch d) line and the rule that a branch-(c)/(d) design checkpoint with no gate line is NOT READY, the ~25-line budget, and the rule that plan files are never written into the deliverable folder. **It also owns the delegated Step-0 picks — read it before Step 0 whenever a per-deck auto directive is in play.**

## At a glance — pipeline · rule strengths · where things live
*A navigation map only; the steps below are the source of truth.*

**Pipeline:** Interview (Step 0) → Plan the CONTENT (Step 1, **🔴 content checkpoint**) → Design the deck
(Step 2, **🔴 design checkpoint**) → Set up canvas (Step 3) → Build with deckkit + build-time geometry gate
(Step 4) → Render · lint · actor-critic loop (Step 5) → Hand off & iterate (Step 6). Steps run in order;
every **🔴 CHECKPOINT** is a hard stop.
**Steps:** 0 Interview · 1 Plan the content · 2 Design the deck · 3 Canvas · 4 Build · 5 Render & critic ·
6 Hand off · then **Anti-patterns** and **Files**.

**Rule-strength vocabulary** (how to read the rules below):

| Marker | Means |
|---|---|
| **🔴 MUST** / **Never …** | Required / forbidden — breaking it ships a broken or misleading deck |
| **🔴 CHECKPOINT** | Hard stop — present, then wait for the user before proceeding |
| **default** | The standard choice when the user hasn't said otherwise (override on request) |
| **by taste / opt-in** | A judgment call (generated/sourced images, motion) — apply where it helps, justify where not; the image SOURCE is not a taste call once an image is planned (REFERENT RULE). Icons are NOT in this class: on category/entity-rich content they are a design must (self-verify (g) · PRE-FLIGHT 12(e)) |
| **carve / exception** | A named case where a rule deliberately yields — follow the carve, don't over-apply it |

> **Enforcement invariant (for anyone evolving this skill):** every 🔴 MUST must be *wired into a gate
> artifact* — an interview question, a required plan field/column, a self-verify item, the PRE-FLIGHT
> checklist (Step 4), a deterministic lint check, or a named critic-rubric item. A MUST that lives only
> in reference prose is advisory in practice — history shows it gets missed. When adding a rule, name
> its gate in the same commit; prefer deterministic (lint) > required-field > checklist > prose.

The table above routes by *concern*. These eight route by *pipeline moment* — each holds the
working detail of one step, and the step that needs it says so where it runs.

**What is NOT here, and why.** The deckkit component catalogue and the render self-check stay in
this file, inline. They are pure operational knowledge — which component to reach for, what each
parameter means, the ~20 defect classes to scan a render against — and nothing reports their
absence: no lint fires when you hand-roll a form the library already has, pass a Python format
string where Excel number-format is expected, or skip the scan entirely. A rule whose omission is
*silent* cannot live behind a read. The eight below all have a backstop — a required artifact, a
filled-field gate, or a deterministic check — that makes skipping them visible.

| Read it at | Owner | What catches you if you skip it |
|---|---|---|
| Step 0, on a deck-build ask, before composing the four questions | `references/interview-protocol.md` | the Step-0 picks FYI can't be written without it |
| Step 1, before writing the comprehension brief | `references/content-plan-spec.md` | the comprehension gate rejects an unfilled brief |
| End of Step 1 and Step 2, before posting either 🔴 checkpoint | `references/checkpoint-convention.md` | the checkpoint artifact is the thing it specifies |
| Step 2, once the plan is approved and any asset is named | `references/asset-production.md` | PRE-FLIGHT 4 (charts) · 5 (evidence) · 12(e) (icons) |
| Step 3, on a non-16:9 surface or a supplied template | `references/deck-setup.md` | `CJK_NO_EA` fails the build on a missing EA font |
| Step 5, at every critic dispatch and returned review | `references/critic-panel.md` | `validate_review.py` rejects a non-conforming review |
| Step 6, before composing the hand-off — every deck | `references/handoff-checklist.md` | the hand-off note is itself the visible artifact |
| Any step, for a script's flags or an unrouted capability | `references/file-inventory.md` | lookup only — nothing depends on having read it |

*(Full file/script inventory: see **Files** at the end.)*

## Step 0 — Interview the user first (always)

> **Scope guard — the build interview fires for DECK-BUILDING asks only** (make/redesign/improve a
> deck or slide). A request to *audit or review this skill/repo*, *critique an existing deck without
> rebuilding it*, *extract/crop figures*, or *answer a question* is NOT a build — do that task
> directly; running the four-question interview there is noise. When in doubt ("improve my deck"
> could be either), one clarifying line beats a wrong assumption.

**Run this interview every time, from scratch — do not skip it because earlier
conversation, a previous deck, or context "obviously" implies an answer.** A terse
request like *"make slides for MICCAI"* specifies only one thing (the venue);
the content, source material, style, and template are all still unknown and must be
**collected, not assumed**. The biggest failure mode is silently carrying over
assumptions from a prior deck in the same session (its topic, its content, its
style, its template) — every deck starts fresh with these questions.

Collect all four answers in **one cheap interview turn**. Match the host UI:
- **If the runtime provides a structured choice UI** (for example Claude Code's
  `AskUserQuestion`), ask the four questions in one batched call with concise options.
- **If the runtime does not provide that UI** (for example plain Codex chat), ask one
  compact direct question and let the user answer in free text. Do not fabricate a fake
  multiple-choice form; give short examples only where they reduce ambiguity.

Direct-question fallback:
```text
Before I build, please give me:
1. Template/brand: existing template, new template, design a clean one, or generate one with an image tool?
2. Purpose/audience/time: who is this for, how long — and is it presented live, screen-shared, sent to self-read, or presented live THEN sent around (hybrid: presented density on-slide, self-sufficient speaker notes)? Main goal: inform, support a decision, or inspire action? — If decide/inspire, one cheap follow-up: what exactly is the ASK, who says yes, and what's the biggest objection you expect? (Duarte's briefing trio; it sharpens the money slide and the close.)
3. Source material: paper, deck, doc, figures, repo, or none? — When material IS provided, one follow-up: condense freely, preserve key phrasing verbatim, or hybrid (verbatim for claims/numbers, condense elsewhere)? Record the answer; it governs every rewrite downstream.
4. Style/language: density (≈a phrase / one sentence / 2–3 sentences per point?), tone (minimal/corporate/academic/playful), and language (中文/English/etc.)?
5. Review effort: `standard` (what your purpose derives) or `thorough`? Say `fast` if you want it
   cheap and accept one generalist critic and a single round — this is the deck's cost dial, and
   `fast` is the only tier you have to ask for.
```

This batching is deliberate: the interview is non-negotiable, so it has to be *cheap*.
Only drop a question if the user already answered *that* one in their current request — or the
deck runs under a full per-deck auto directive, where you answer the preference questions by
delegation and post the picks as the first FYI (see **the per-deck AUTO WAIVER**; the topic /
source-material floor still gets asked);
when in doubt, keep it. Never assume the **topic/content**, the **style**, or **which
template** — confirm each.

**Ask the `review:` effort tier in the same batch — it is a first-class interview axis, not a
footnote.** One word (`fast` | `standard` | `thorough`) scales BOTH cost centres, the research
fan-out and the review panel, and its default is DERIVED from the purpose the same question
already collects. 🔴 **`fast` is opt-in only and never derived**, so the derivation has just two
rows — `standard` and `thorough` — and they are pure ALIASES for the low-stakes and high-stakes
behaviour the skill already had. The full table (which purpose maps where, and the rule that
purpose decides while SIZE never lowers a tier) is in `references/interview-protocol.md`; it and
this sentence must agree — change one, change both. Aliasing rather than redefining is what makes
the dial safe: **a user who says nothing gets the behaviour that predates it.** This
axis exists because the scaling rule was always in the rubric and never on the menu — a single
low-stakes deck measured ~32 subagents and ~2M tokens at full weight, and the user had no way to
say "less". Options, the derivation table and the 🔴 rule that a downgrade must be stated and
recorded: `references/interview-protocol.md`; what each tier dispatches:
`references/critic-panel.md` → "Review effort tiers".

**🔴 Read `references/interview-protocol.md` before you ask anything on a build ask** — it owns the rest of Step 0: two-stage personalization from THIS user's footprint + `taste.md` precedence (🔴 MUST: current request > this interview's answers > `taste.md`), scaling the interview to the ask, Q1's four template choices (a)–(d) — all four MUST be offered, never a hardcoded institution — with each branch, Q2's delivery · deck-length · appear-builds · primary-goal axes + per-purpose cases + venue research, and Q3's source-material routing per input format.
> **One 🔴 CHECKPOINT lives in that file:** the Q1(d) generated-template **hero checkpoint** (show the hero + a sample content slide, iterate until the user confirms). The Q1(c) **direction gate** (4 rendered directions) RUNS BY DEFAULT on the design-a-clean-one branch — skippable only via its named carves, and recorded on the design checkpoint's `direction gate:` line.

   - **Their own deck, to *improve*** (e.g. "redesign this", "my slides are too
     dense", "make my deck better") → this is a redesign, not a build-from-scratch, and
     it rewards a different front end. **Follow `references/redesign-existing-deck.md`**:
     ask two extra answers in the same interview turn — *keep your
     design/branding, or redesign the look?* and *how deep — light cleanup keeping your
     structure, or full re-author?* — **these REPLACE the Q1 template question** (the R0 rule in
     `references/redesign-existing-deck.md`): *keep* makes their deck the template; *redesign the
     look* triggers Q1's four choices as a post-batch follow-up — and **diagnose their deck first** (render it,
     extract its content/figures with `scripts/extract_deck.py`, run the critic on it),
     then show the weakness list and confirm scope **before** rebuilding. Optimizing
     someone's existing deck rewards a diagnosis-led, scope-confirmed approach over a
     silent ground-up replacement.
     > **🔴 CHECKPOINT** — show the diagnosis + proposed scope and get the user's OK before rebuilding their deck.

**Q4 (style) — density levels, mimic modes, and the direction-gate scope are in `references/interview-protocol.md` (same file, later section). Read it before you offer the style question.** It owns the three DENSITY levels (diagram-heavy / balanced / text-heavy, defined by text-per-point) and the mimic-a-style-example modes — two user choices that exist ONLY here, so if this file is not opened they get silently defaulted.

**Language (decide it, then hold it).** A deck is written in **one language
throughout** — default to the language the *user* writes in. **When the source
material is in a different language than the user** (e.g. an English-speaking user with
a Chinese codebase/paper), or it's otherwise ambiguous, **ask which language the slides
should be in** — don't assume the source's. **When you ask the language, also offer
bilingual as an option** (e.g. "English only, 中文 only, or bilingual EN+中文?") so a user
who'd benefit doesn't have to volunteer it. Then translate the content into that language
and keep every slide consistent. Established technical terms, proper nouns, acronyms,
units, and code may stay in their original form (that's not "mixing"). Build a
**mixed/bilingual** deck only if the user asks (or picks it) — and then do it
systematically (same pairing on every slide). See `references/multilingual.md`.

## Step 1 — Understand & plan the CONTENT (use the content-planner)
**Use `agents/content-planner.md` for this step — the CONTENT only** — dispatch
it through an available multi-agent/subagent tool when the host exposes one (in Codex,
discover multi-agent tools with `tool_search` if needed), otherwise run the same planner
brief inline yourself. It is the
constructive counterpart to the critic/arbiter judges. Give it the interview answers
(purpose/audience/time, **delivery context** & **primary goal**, style/language, template
decision, venue if any **plus the Step-0 venue-research findings — the planner builds on them
(re-verify, don't re-research)**), the source material (or "none"), and the content references
(`review-rubrics.md` — the content lens — and `multilingual.md`), and the **`search cap:`** below. *(The design references —
`design-principles.md`, `design-by-purpose.md`, `form-selection.md`, `schematic-diagrams.md`,
`animation.md`, `image-generation.md` — belong to the slide-design agent in Step 2, not here.)*
It returns a **Content plan** — message only, no design: a comprehension brief + a claim ledger
+ the authors'-emphasis check + the narrative arc (incl. the planned **emotional curve** + what's
deliberately staged for later slides) + a per-slide CONTENT spec (takeaway that passes the
memory test · **role · question · beat** · content units · visual source: which figure/number/data
+ which question — what/how/why), plus flagged forward-looking content and open questions. You then take that plan into the **Step-1 CONTENT
checkpoint** (show it, get the user's OK on the story/message — the pace/slide-count check happens
HERE); only *after* content is approved does the slide-design agent design the look (Step 2). The
planner is *one mind* — it may fan out *reading* across multiple documents, but it synthesises the
understanding, arc, and per-slide message itself; never split one paper across blind agents. For a
quick, low-stakes deck you may do this pass inline yourself rather than dispatching — but
the deep-understanding and planning standard below is the same either way.
**🔴 Hand the planner a `search cap:` too — and do the SMALL, NAMED lookups BEFORE dispatching it.**
Web search is capped per SESSION, shared with every subagent, and it does not reset between decks in
one conversation. Measured: one research fan-out — 12 agents plus 7 verifiers, none of them told a
cap existed — spent all 200, and the bill arrived hours later when a single lookup for a company's
official logo could not run and that deck shipped without it. The cheap, late, small queries starve
because the big early fan-out took everything, so fix it in the order that buys the most: (1) run the
handful of NAMED lookups first — the logo, the brand colours, the one clearance number — since they
are few, they are exactly what starves, and Step 2 needs them anyway; (2) state a per-agent cap **in
each dispatch prompt** — an agent not told a cap searches until satisfied, and N of them do it in
parallel — keeping the whole round under about half of what REMAINS, not half of the original cap;
(3) carry `searches: planned N / spent N` to the hand-off `cost:` line. If the budget does run out,
say so on the deck's limitations page and in the hand-off: **"could not verify" must never be allowed
to look like "does not exist"** (full rationale at Step 5's SEARCH BUDGET block).
**Hand the planner the `review:` effort tier too** — the same one word collected at Step 0 sizes
this research sweep and the Step-5 panel, because the two measured comparable on a real deck
(~1.02M tokens of research against ~0.95M of review) and a user asking for speed means the
pipeline, not half of it. What the tier narrows is BREADTH, never the fidelity floor: every claim
that reaches a slide is still traced to a primary source at every tier. If no tier was collected,
the planner works at `standard` and says so.

The rest of this step is the **specification the planner works to** (and what
you check its plan against). The bar — understand it deeply, don't skim:

A deck is only as good as your grasp of the material — a superficial read produces a
deck that *looks* right but misrepresents the work, which an expert audience spots
instantly. Read **all of it**, not the abstract: run the code's README, read the
paper end-to-end (intro → method → **every results table/figure** → conclusion).
*(That end-to-end read is the default for a BOUNDED source; for a LONG source — a book /
very long PDF / large corpus — do NOT fake a single linear read: classify the size, then
run **long-source mode** (map → triage → deep-read the load-bearing ~20% + a blocking
Source-coverage map). See the long-source bullet below and `content-planner.md` §1.)*

Then **write a comprehension brief — a REQUIRED, fixed-field, source-traced artifact** (the
planner's `agents/content-planner.md` §1 is the spec); every field must trace to a locatable
source span, not memory:

- **The field list is in `references/content-plan-spec.md` §Comprehension brief — read it before writing (or checking) the brief.** It holds the one-sentence message + its verbatim source sentence, the contributions, the method essence, the one-row-per-figure-AND-table spec, the nuance/limitation quotes, and the claim-ledger columns (same spec as `agents/content-planner.md` §1–2).

**This is a hard gate, not a sanity check.** Self-verify the brief against the source; if any
field is empty, hedged, or untraced — or the emphasis test fails (your one-sentence message
would surprise the authors) — you have NOT understood it: re-read or log an open question.
**An incomplete or untraced brief blocks the build.** Every slide must be faithful to the
authors' actual emphasis, not a plausible-sounding paraphrase. Reuse their figures
(relabel for the slide).

**Having a source is rarely the whole story — use the web for the gaps, even with one.**
Most decks are *partial*: a paper that needs related-work-since-publication or current
framing, a code repo with no writeup, figures with no prose, a doc that omits the venue. So
the web step below is **not only for the "No content" case** — run it whenever a source
leaves a gap, and in particular **re-verify the source's own falsifiable / time-bound claims
at *today's* date**: a paper's "state-of-the-art", an adoption number, a "first/largest/
latest" superlative may be stale by presentation day. Re-verifying a source claim is not
inventing — it's fidelity to what's *true now*.

- **No content — and any web fact-check on any deck:** draft the outline from your own expertise, then ground *and verify* every falsifiable claim against a **primary** source, and ground the deck to *today*. **Read `references/content-plan-spec.md` §Web verification & no-source decks before running any search or putting a falsifiable/time-bound claim on a slide** — it owns the PROVENANCE CONTRACT, the re-verify-on-every-build list, the dated-event tense rule, and the no-web-tool fallback.

- **A long source (a book / very long PDF / large corpus / multi-volume set)** is NOT read front-to-back — a faked linear read either overflows or, worse, *fits* and goes shallow. **The moment a source might exceed ~40–50 pp or not fit one pass, read `references/content-plan-spec.md` §Long-source mode** — deterministic size classification (`extract_pdf.py map`, CJK counting, multi-file sum), structure map, triage, the verbatim ~20% deep-read with page-traced claims, **page-scoped figure locators (never whole-document `autofig`)**, the Source-coverage map, the TWO-PHASE dispatch that posts the selection FYI *before* the deep-read, and the scanned/DRM no-text case.

**End Step 1 at the 🔴 CONTENT checkpoint — pace-check first, then approve the story.** The
Content plan is the cheapest place to fix a misread or a wrong emphasis, so present it *before any
design begins*: the **comprehension brief + claim ledger** FIRST (so the user can spot a misread
before a single slide is designed), then the **authors'-emphasis check**, the **narrative arc**,
and the **per-slide takeaways + content** (message only — no look yet), plus any flagged
forward-looking content and open questions. **The pace / slide-count check happens HERE, not
later:** for a *spoken* deck scale the slide count to the time budget — ~1 slide per talking-minute
as a loose anchor (short talk/status ~6–9, lecture/thesis defense/job talk ~10–20+), counting an
animated/build slide *once*; compute `slide_count ÷ time_minutes` and, if it runs well over ~1/min,
cut slides or get more time and flag it. A *read-alone / poster* deck has no talking-minute budget —
its scope is set by content completeness, and deliberate density is fine, not a defect. **Confirm
the resulting slide count** with the user (never ship a length they never saw). **For a long source
(book / very long PDF), the checkpoint ALSO carries a DIGEST of the Source-coverage map** (the chosen
slice + a built-around/summarised/cut tally; the full per-chapter map stays in the plan) **and
confirms the SELECTION.** Ordering matters: the verbatim deep-read that produces the verified ledger
happens *inside* Step 1, so the wrong-slice must be caught earlier — the planner surfaces the coverage
map as a **cheap selection FYI right after mapping+triage, before sinking the verbatim deep-read**,
and it is re-confirmed here **before DESIGN and BUILD (Step 2+) commit.** The wrong-slice risk is the
biggest one at book scale, so it is surfaced even under the auto-waiver (as an FYI). **Precondition —
the comprehension gate:** before showing the plan, confirm it carries a *complete* comprehension
brief (every field filled + traced) and claim ledger (no shipped `verified? = N` rows), **a
Takeaway spine that reads as one argument** (an incoherent spine is "not ready" — send it back to
the planner), a `scripts/plan_wordcount.py` pass over the per-slide table (advisory — but an
over-budget row with no recorded "over budget → notes/split" resolution goes back too), **a
`source size:` line on any file-sourced deck** (the bounded-vs-long classification must be a
recorded measurement — its absence means the classification never ran), **for an over-threshold
long source a complete Source-coverage map** (a disposition for every **skeleton section** — the
`map` TOC *or* the recorded reconstructed skeleton, every file for a multi-file source — + the
verbatim-vs-skimmed line + the `selection FYI:` line; a missing/partial map is "not ready"), **and
for a video-sourced deck the transcript-status line** (supplied locator or the visual-only GAP
line); an empty/hedged/untraced brief is **not ready** — send it back to the planner. Fold in the
user's edits to the story, then move to design (Step 2).

## Step 2 — Design the deck (use the slide-design agent)

With the **Content plan approved**, first build the **Evidence manifest** — one READ-ONLY probe line per asset the approved plan names, so the art director plans geometry with its eyes open (a no-asset deck skips it entirely). **Read `references/asset-production.md` §Evidence manifest before dispatching slide-design** for the line format, the probing tools, and the rule that probing NEVER materializes crops/equations/plates (asset-prep still runs only after the design plan is approved). That file is the asset lifecycle end-to-end — probe → image opt-in → crops → charts → logo/icons → equations.

**The per-asset SPEC asset-prep consumes has a named producer:** the Design plan's per-slide rows
(or its image opt-in list) carry, per asset, the crop spec (or `autofig index N` — **but on a
long-source deck the locator must be page-scoped**: `figures <src> <page>` + the caption label,
never a whole-document `autofig` index, whose global numbering shifts between runs), a generated
plate's topical prompt, an equation's target height, and a GIF's poster frame — and where the
approved plan left one implicit, the COORDINATOR completes it from the plan's own geometry when
assembling asset-prep's work order (asset-prep itself never decides these; it only executes).
Then dispatch `agents/slide-design.md` — the deck's **art director**
— to design the look on top of the locked message. Dispatch it through an available multi-agent/
subagent tool when the host exposes one, otherwise run the same brief inline. Give it the **approved
Content plan** (comprehension brief, claim ledger, narrative arc with its emotional curve, and the
per-slide CONTENT table with each slide's *role · question · beat* and *visual source* cells),
**the Evidence manifest** (asset geometry, above), the **taste lines** —
`taste.md`'s DIALS + NO-GOs + its LAST look-history line, read from the registry root per
`references/user-taste.md` ("none on file" for a brand-new user) — so §1 Freshness has something
real to vary against and the chrome-budget default is seeded, while the interview's explicit
answers and the LOCKED-look carve always outrank them, the
interview answers that steer register
(purpose/audience/time, delivery mode, style, template/brand decision, venue — plus, when the user
gave a Q4 style example, the **written style brief + chosen mimic mode**), and the craft
references it designs against (`form-selection.md`, `design-gallery.md`, `scripts/presets.py`,
`design-by-purpose.md`, `design-principles.md`, `design-intelligence-addendum.md`, `semantic-color-contract.md`, `data-viz.md`,
`schematic-diagrams.md`, `icons.md`, `animation.md`, `image-generation.md`,
`east-asian-aesthetic.md` — and, for a mimic deck, `style-analysis.md`). It consumes the approved content — it does **not** reopen it — and
returns a **Design plan**: the deck's **Design language** (a *named* signature motif + a
deliberately-chosen palette/type + the polish moves), the **deck rhythm**, a **per-slide design
table** (form + the runner-up it beat · reasoning · layout · motion · image?), the
**Form ledger + diversity gate**, the **design self-verify checks**, the **10-item design-critic
checklist** (which the Step-5 critic's design lens then applies), and the **image opt-in list**. The
art director is *one mind* over the whole deck — only it sees every slide at once, so deck rhythm and
where the appear-builds fall are its call, not the builder's.

**The design plan is the cheapest place to change visual direction**, so end the step by showing it
and getting the user's OK before the canvas is set up or anything is built. **This design intelligence
runs on EVERY deck — it's how the art director designs, never opt-in per deck — and scales down
gracefully to small decks (a 4-slide deck still earns one hero per slide, no card-grid reflex, semantic
colour, and one memorable moment); only the deck-level numeric floors are size-gated (hard at ~8+ content
slides, strong guidance at 6–7).** **Precondition — the design gate:** the plan is **not ready** unless it has a concrete **Design language** (a *named*
signature motif + a deliberately-chosen palette/type, not a defaulted light/minimal/blue), a one-line
**taste-profile field** in that Design language section — `taste profile: <n dials applied / none on
file> · freshness: varied <foundation> vs <last look-history line>`, or the alternate arm `look
LOCKED (registered/provided template) — carve applies` — the line that makes the freshness rule
checkable and any profile override visible (`references/user-taste.md`), **a `boldness:` line
(conservative | balanced+ | bold | experimental — default balanced+) AND a real `signature move:`
line** — the ONE deliberate aesthetic RISK a template wouldn't make, scoped to where it lands (cover /
WOW / money slide) and adapting a named bold reference, **plus a `carried_by:` clause naming 2–3
slides (the signature slide + ≥1 more) where the same idea does STRUCTURAL work** — one brave slide
among nineteen safe ones reads as a tonal break, not a position; coherence is what makes daring look
deliberate. Carried means the idea becomes the *shape of the content* on those slides (the motif
turns into the diagram's own geometry), **not** a decorative repeat — a device stamped on every page
is the opposite failure and the motif budget (≤3 appearances) still binds; a `signature move` that reduces to "a big
number / a nice gradient / a full-bleed photo" is the safe catalogue, **not** a signature move, and
makes the plan incomplete (send it back; self-verify (h) owns this) — only `boldness: conservative`
(whether user-set or purpose-defaulted) makes the risk optional, softening the field to a named
"deliberately restrained" clause so it's never blank; the risk lives on
composition/scale/concept/type and **never** overrides a floor (legibility/fidelity/lint win), **an
`AR a.b -> <zone>` annotation in the Layout cell of every slide placing a manifest-listed
figure/table** (a plan that commits a known-geometry asset to a zone without checking the fit is
not ready — send it back to the art director; the slide-design §3 Image-fit rule owns the
re-form-vs-taste-reason call), a **Form
ledger** whose diversity gate passes (no one format-family on >~40–50% of content slides — the
card-overuse guard), the addendum's **deck-level design gates** — a **rhythm map**, a **semantic-colour
ledger**, a passing **block-dependency audit** (no >2 consecutive card slides), and the **minimum
deck-level variation** (`references/design-intelligence-addendum.md`) — plus, for a **company / product /
single-entity** deck (its subject IS one org / product / brand / institution, or a talk naming a
tool/framework/model), a **logo plan WITH EVIDENCE** per the slide-design LOGO PRINCIPLE's situation
table: the line must read `official asset — <source>`, `searched, none found → designed wordmark
(flagged)`, or `n/a — <multi-entity | template carries it | user opted out>` — a bare "wordmark"/
"text only" with no recorded search, or a missing line on a single-entity deck, makes the plan
**incomplete** (send it back; self-verify (o) owns this) — and the **THREE
DESIGN MUSTS** addressed (`slide-design.md`'s three design musts) —
**(1) appear-builds — ONLY if the user opted in** (the interview's presented-deck choice): if IN, a
motion manifest places builds where they help (build/static *with a reason* per slide) and each built
slide is staged FULLY (every content element in a step, deliberate order); if OUT, every slide is
`static: user opted out` and that is complete, not a gap. **(2) a style-matched SVG icon family** on any
category/entity-rich deck — every branch, incl. generated-template (self-verify (g); "opt-in" never waives it), **(3) diverse formats** (not a card grid repeated) — musts 2–3 are
*applied where they help or justified where not* (a must to consider + apply, never a blank per-slide
quota — still smart about where/when). A plan that defaults its look, over-relies on one format, forgets
icons, or — when builds are opted in — leaves a built slide half-staged or forgets builds where they'd
clearly help is **not ready** — send it back to the art director.

**🔴 One row of the LOGO PRINCIPLE table decides BEFORE the search and overrides its result: a
THIRD-PARTY ASSESSMENT.** The deck is *about* an entity but is not *from* it, and carries what that
entity would not publish about itself — open recalls, a "first but not unique" correction, a
limitations page, competitor counter-evidence. There the answer is `n/a — third-party assessment`
plus the finding that makes it so: **no official livery on any page**, the entity's name set in the
deck's own type. The test is authorship, not sentiment — a favourable independent review has the
same problem as a critical one. A reader seeing the mark concludes the entity produced or endorsed
this, and for an independent assessment that is a misattribution: the same class of error as an
unsourced number, committed in the chrome instead of the body. Because it is a question about who
wrote the deck, finding a real logo does not overturn it and "not found" is never its reason.
*(Real: a briefing carrying two open Class I recalls and a "first, but not alone" correction was
headed for build in its subject's brand colours; it was caught by hand and recorded as a named
deviation. This row makes that the default instead of a save.)*

**The per-slide content-image opt-in is a CROSS-CUTTING choice available on EVERY deck** — independent of the template decision and separate from Q1's generate-a-template path; offer it whenever an image tool OR web search for sourced photos is available. **Read `references/asset-production.md` §Per-slide content-image opt-in before writing the opt-in list** — the three guardrails (content-related, never every slide, and the REFERENT RULE that decides generated vs real sourced imagery) and the per-row source-token grammar. Fold in the user's design edits, then set up the canvas (Step 3).

## Step 3 — Set up the canvas
**First, decide where the deck lands.** Deliver each deck as one self-contained
folder in the user's Downloads — `~/Downloads/<deck-name>/`, holding the
`<deck-name>.pptx` and a `render/` subfolder of slide PNGs — so the user gets a tidy,
findable bundle rather than a stray file in `/tmp`.
**🔴 The `.pdf` and `viewer.html` are NOT produced during the build.** A deck is iterated
— rebuilt each critic round, then usually hand-edited in PowerPoint — so a PDF and a preview
page generated on every render are churn: they clutter the deck root and go **stale** the moment
the `.pptx` changes, which is worse than absent (a user opens a stale PDF and reviews the wrong
deck). They are **reserved deliverables**: at hand-off (step 6), once the user confirms the deck
is final, offer them and generate both with `render_deck … --deliverables`. Point your build script's
output path and `render_deck.sh`'s out-dir there from the start (no need to copy
files around at the end). **Before the first save, confirm `~/Downloads` exists; if
it doesn't, ask the user where they'd like outputs** and use that location instead —
don't silently dump into `/tmp`. You'll remind them to open it in step 6.
> **🔴 CHECKPOINT** — if `~/Downloads` is missing, ask where to save before writing any file.
> *(Per-deck auto: this checkpoint is a question, so it has no FYI form — do not stop. Default:
> `mkdir -p ~/Downloads` when the home directory is writable (keeps the standard
> `~/Downloads/<deck>/` layout every reference assumes); only if home is unwritable, use
> `./<deck-name>/` in the working directory. Never `/tmp`. State the chosen location in chat the
> moment you decide it — auto mode is never invisible — and repeat it in the hand-off.)*

**Canvas format.** The default deck is 16:9 via `deckkit.blank_deck()` — untouched, and everything below assumes it. **If the interview confirmed any non-16:9 surface (4:3 venue · 小红书 3:4 · square 1:1 · story 9:16 · A4 print) — or the design plan carries a `format:` line that isn't `wide` — read `references/deck-setup.md` §Canvas format BEFORE creating the presentation object**; it carries the `scripts/formats.py` contract (`band` safe rect · `chrome` · `columns_ok` · `display_scale` · `lint_flags`) and the rule that the design plan records a `format:` line whenever it isn't `wide`.

**Keep the per-deck build script (`build_<deck>.py`) in that same folder, beside the
`.pptx`.** The build script — not the rendered file — is the *source of truth* for the
deck, so it should travel with the artifact: this makes every later iteration
reproducible (re-run it, get the same deck) and is what lets you fold the user's
later change requests back into the build rather than hand-patching the binary. See
`references/handoff-and-iteration.md` for why this matters at hand-off and how to
iterate without clobbering the user's manual edits. In that script, resolve deck assets
relative to the script file (for example `ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent`) rather
than the current working directory, so `python /path/to/build_<deck>.py` works from anywhere.

- **Template branch** — the user supplied a `.pptx`, or Step 0 found an official conference template: read `references/deck-setup.md` → "Template branch" BEFORE creating the deck object (inspect → `open_template()` → adopt the template's brand → register a reusable `profile.md`).

- **No-template branch** — you are designing the look yourself: read `references/deck-setup.md` → "No-template branch" BEFORE the first palette/preset/font call (`set_palette` semantics — a bare `deckkit.MAGENTA = …` does NOT re-theme components whose signature default binds at import · `scripts/presets.py` · `references/design-by-purpose.md` · `references/design-gallery.md`). Two rules that survive no matter what: **never ship deckkit's default blue, and never reuse the last deck's scheme** — each deck gets its own distinct identity.

**Fonts (every deck, both branches).** A `.pptx` stores font *names*, not the fonts — before setting `deckkit.FONT`/`MONO`/`EAFONT`/`EQ_MATHFONT`, read `references/deck-setup.md` → "Fonts" (CJK `EAFONT` is required for any 中文/日本語/한국어 deck; portability, the `EQ_MATHFONT` / STIX / Cambria Math dependency to flag at hand-off, and tofu recovery live there) and flag any font dependency at hand-off.

## Step 4 — Build with deckkit

> ### 🔴 Step 4 opens with the SIGNATURE PROOF — one slide, rendered, BEFORE the other slides exist
> The `boldness:` / `signature move:` contract is approved as **prose**. The pixels that either honour
> it or sand it back to safe do not appear until Step 5, after the whole deck is built — at which point
> the critic's "the signature move got sanded" finding costs a rebuild, and that cost is exactly why it
> gets accepted instead of fixed. **Put the evidence where the decision is:**
> 1. Author the **signature slide first** (the one the `signature move:` line names) — plus its
>    `carried_by:` partner if the idea's structural claim is only legible across the pair.
> 2. Build, then render just that page:
>    `python3 scripts/render_deck.py <deck>.pptx <out> --slides N` (~5s vs ~12s full; the PNG is
>    byte-identical to the same page from a full render, so it is evidence, not an approximation).
> 3. **Post the PNG** with one line: *"this is what `<signature move>` actually looks like."* A 🔴 stop
>    in the default flow; under a per-deck AUTO WAIVER it downgrades to a posted FYI like every other
>    approval stop — the waiver removes the wait, never the artifact.
> 4. Then author the rest. If the proof is wrong you have re-authored ONE slide, not twenty.
> 5. **Record it** — the run carries a `signature proof:` token to Step 5 on the critic contract
>    card: `signature proof: slide N → <png path>` or `skipped: <the named carve>`. Without it the
>    step is advisory by construction, which is the failure mode this whole batch exists to fix:
>    the critic can then check the SHIPPED signature slide against the frame that was approved, and
>    a silent skip is visible instead of invisible.
>
> **Skip only when:** `boldness: conservative` with its "deliberately restrained" clause recorded (no
> risk was taken, so there is nothing to prove), or a 1–2 slide tiny-ask. A registered/provided template
> does NOT skip it — a borrowed look still has a signature slide, and that is exactly where a template
> deck either becomes designed or stays a template.
>
> *(Measured: build ≈ 1.8s, `--slides` render ≈ 4.7s vs 12.3s full. The proof costs less than one

> Asset note: the signature slide's assets are the first thing asset-prep delivers, per its brief.
> One render can serve several rituals: when Gate A's one-real-slide fidelity confirm has not yet

> If the proof looks WRONG: revise the signature slide in the same build script and re-run the same

> CURRENT index, so if later authoring renumbers it, the `signature proof:` token records the final
> number at hand-off.)*

Write a small per-deck build script that imports `scripts/deckkit.py` (don't re-derive primitives;
full signatures + behaviour are in its docstrings). **Build the approved Design plan** (form ledger,
rhythm, per-slide design, colour, logo) as the source of truth — the slide-design agent already chose
each slide's visual FORM and the user approved it at the DESIGN checkpoint, so **don't re-derive an
approved form.** *Fallback only where the plan left something open:* pick that slide's form deliberately —
generate 2-3 candidate forms and choose with the tie-breaker in `references/form-selection.md`;
**don't default every multi-item slide to a card grid.**
> **🔴 When a COMPONENT exists for the form, BUILD that component — do NOT hand-roll a substitute from

> every axis / baseline / track extent from the data** (`last_bar_x_end − axis_x`, never a hand-picked
> width), and don't double-count (`references/design-principles.md` "Designed plots" + "Big numbers").
The helper set, by job:
- **Chrome:** `title_bar`/`content_slide`, `footer`, `editorial_header` (caps eyebrow + title +
  hairline), `part_eyebrow`/`page_marker` (mono eyebrow + page marker), `logo` (persistent
  brand/institution/product mark in a fixed corner on every page — see the brand-logo rule below).
- **Safe layout — measure or anchor, never hand-pick a y:** `columns`/`rows` (equal **or
  `weights=`-proportioned** split panels — a measured 1/3–2/3 or rail+main split — symmetric outer
  margins either way), `content_band` (the SAFE rect below title / above footer), **`bottom_callout`**
  (footer-safe bottom takeaway — anchors to the band, grows UP, can't collide), **`vstack(…, bottom=)`**
  (measured stack: equal gaps + no overlap by construction, errors at build time on overflow) with the
  `measure_callout/measure_bullets/measure_text` helpers, **`spaced_centers`** (evenly-spaced marker
  centers for a timeline / tick row / numbered steps, **inset at the ends so a centered caption stays
  co-centered with its end marker** — use it instead of hand-rolling a row of dots+captions, which
  desyncs the first/last caption from its dot near a slide edge; `timeline` already uses it),
  `picture` (`fit="contain"` keeps edges /
  `"cover"` crops), `make_gif` (GENERATE a looping GIF from computed frames) + `gif` (embed the animated
  GIF, undistorted + size/still warnings) + `gif_poster` (extract the first/representative frame to
  verify what the render & PDF export show) — generate → embed → review, `icon`/`icon_tile`/
  `icon_badge`/`icon_ghost`/`icon_card` (place an open-licensed SVG icon — recolored + rasterized via
  `scripts/icons.py`, which also does **duotone** weights + **gradient-fill**; `icon_tile` is the
  versatile container — circle/squircle/square × solid/gradient/glass tile, `icon_badge` a ring badge,
  `icon_ghost` an oversized faint watermark, `icon_card` the upper-left feature-card pattern; vary the
  treatment to fit the deck — see `references/icons.md` "Treatments"). *(These exist so you never
  hardcode a low `y` — the recurring overlap/footer bug.)*
- **Text & blocks:** `bullet`, `callout` (auto-grows), `chip`, `modbox` (a labelled MODULE box —
  reach for it as the node when mapping architecture modules / code files / system parts joined by
  `connector`, where a plain `node` is too bare; role word + optional filename/tag), `arrow`, `table` (highlight
  the key row), `code_block`, `hrule`.
- **Colour:** `palette(n, ACCENTS)` (n distinct, contrast-checked fills — warns on adjacent same-hue;
  never a gray filler), `palette_from_image` (match a generated template's palette), `accent_one`
  (one-accent discipline), `contrast_ratio` (verify ≥~4.5:1 before committing).
- **Data furniture & charts:** `scorecard`/`leaderboard`/`takeaway_rail`, `change_stat` (baseline-
  centred before→after), `stat_row`, `big_numeral`; **editable native charts** `native_chart` /
  `native_dual_axis` / `native_donut` / `native_pareto` / `native_bubble` (feed them straight from a
  spreadsheet with **`series_from_csv(path, x_col, y_cols)`** → `(categories, series)`, stdlib, no pandas),
  plus the raster recipes in `scripts/designed_charts.py` (incl. **`waterfall`** — a total's rise/fall/
  total walk, semantic up/down colour) — pick per `references/data-viz.md`.
- **Walkthrough / hierarchy / comparison-grid:** **`annotated_figure`** (a real figure + numbered
  markers + a numbered caption rail + optional magnified inset — the guided figure walkthrough the
  integral-figure rule kept demanding by hand) · **`small_multiples`** (identical mini native charts
  with a SHARED value axis — the documented recipe left each panel auto-scaling, so a small bump and
  a huge bump looked identical) · **`position_map`** (N LABELLED items on two continuous axes — the
  within-cell position quadrant() throws away) · **`org_tree`** (tidy hierarchy: centroid parents,
  horizontal bus; raises when it can't fit legibly).
- **2.5D isometric (native — no generated image):** **`iso_bars`** (a FAITHFUL 2.5D bar chart —
  extrusion height is linear in the value and zero-based, so the depth never distorts the data) ·
  **`iso_stack`** (a layered architecture / disclosure ladder / decision stack — floating isometric
  slabs with labels aligned beside each one) · **`iso_prism`** (one extruded block as a hero).
  Fixed projection (true 30° isometric, parallel not perspective) and one-light-source face shading,
  so every 2.5D element in a deck reads as one system. **Dose like generated imagery** — a stack, a
  hierarchy, or ONE hero chart, never every slide; text cannot be sheared onto a face, so labels sit
  beside the geometry. When the 2.5D wants to be a rich atmospheric *scene* (not data), that is the
  generated-image branch, not these.
- **Placement by measurement:** `image_fx.quiet_region(path)` → the image's calmest ONE-INK region
  + its mean luminance (choose dark vs light ink from data, not eyeballing) · `deckkit.pic_alpha`
  (native picture opacity — a faint plate that keeps its own hues, no scrim shape) ·
  `deckkit.design_intent(slide, envelope=…, rhyme=…)` (declare a deliberate quiet/baseline/bleed
  register so the render-time lint audits intent instead of guessing it).
- **Decision / plan / grid:** **`eval_matrix`** (options×criteria scoring grid — `harvey_ball` fifths-fill
  glyphs or ✓/◐/✕ marks, `recommend=` tints the winner) · **`heat_matrix`** (category×category grid coloured
  by value, `scale="seq"|"div"|"risk"`) · **`tier_stack`** (one taper: `mode="funnel"` drop-off /
  `mode="pyramid"` layers, + `funnel()`/`pyramid()` wrappers) · **`gantt`** (dated task bars on a shared
  `axis_scale`, `lanes=` swimlanes, `today=` marker — durations & overlap, where `timeline` shows only points).
- **Diagrams / patterns:** `quadrant`, `hub_spoke`, `timeline`, `before_after`/`image_tab`/
  `photo_triptych`, **`device_frame`** (a real screenshot in a `chrome="browser"`/`"phone"` bezel),
  `wireframe_grid`+`spec_list`, `corner_frame`, `photo_card`, `backdrop_motif`,
  `repeat_row` (N identical-except-index units as representatives + `…` + `×N`, shared detail said
  once — never N duplicate blocks).
- **Surface (dark / glass / print):** `glass_card`/`glow`/`scrim_overlay` (gradient+alpha fill),
  `offset_shadow` (hard letterpress/riso shadow).
- **Publication & math:** `cover`/`colophon` (bookend the deck), `sources_page`, `specimen_card`;
  **`equation_native`** (EDITABLE LaTeX-subset math — real text runs, renders everywhere; the default) /
  `equation_png` (rasterised LaTeX, for 2-D math: fractions/matrices) / `eq_par` (inline runs).
- **East-Asian (CJK) accents:** `seal` (vermilion chop/印章 stamp — the one red accent on an ink deck),
  `cjk_numeral` (壹·贰·叁 section markers vs Latin "01"). See `references/east-asian-aesthetic.md`.
- **Diagram kit (general flowcharts):** `node` + `connector` / `flow_chain` (straight links between adjacent nodes) + `elbow_connector` /
  `loop_path` (elbow / U-shaped paths for a feedback/repeat loop, a return, or a link between NON-adjacent
  nodes) — any architecture from rounded-rect/pill/circle nodes (+ diamond/parallelogram/cylinder when
  formal flowchart notation applies — see the Standard-notation crib in `design-gallery.md`) with
  **stroke semantics** (solid=required
  · dashed=optional · dotted=feedback) and **shape semantics** (straight=adjacent flow · elbow/U=loop /
  return / non-adjacent), exactly one `hub` (hub optional in the system-architecture recipe — the
  focal path can carry emphasis instead)  *(NB two similarly-named helpers: **`hub_spoke`** draws the
  whole radial FIGURE — one centre + labelled spoke nodes on a ring; **`hub_spokes`** only draws the
  CONNECTORS from an existing hub to existing nodes. Reach for `hub_spoke` to build the diagram,
  `hub_spokes` to wire one you laid out yourself.)* the
  focal path can carry emphasis instead); `diagram_island` (bright figure panel on a dark slide);
  `concentric_rings` (nested framework); `step_list` (numbered process, vertical/horizontal).
  - **This kit draws conceptual BOX-FLOW only — not physical science schematics.** For a
    **labelled science schematic** explaining a principle / mechanism / experiment / definition (a
    **free-body / force diagram, optics ray path, electric circuit, chemistry apparatus + reaction,
    vector / coordinate geometry, wave / field** — physics · chemistry · biology · engineering · any
    subject), NOT the node/connector kit. Two faithful build paths (pick by precision-vs-polish):
    **matplotlib / a domain library** → transparent PNG (the safe default when the exact geometry/labels
    ARE the meaning — deterministic, correct-by-construction), OR — for a **complex / fancy / generated-
    template-matched** schematic whose geometry isn't load-bearing — the **OpenAI image tool for a
    text-free styled visual with the labels overlaid as native editable text**. **Never bake labels or
    unverifiable geometry into a generated image** (garbled text + wrong physics). Recipes, the
    image-tool workflow, and the **domain-accuracy fidelity gate** are in
    `references/schematic-diagrams.md` — build it correct (a wrong schematic misleads worse than none).
- **Editorial / consulting furniture:** `insight_banner` (so-what bar), `bilingual_lockup` (CJK+tracked
  Latin headline), `highlight` (inline `<k>keyword</k>` recolour), `ghost_numeral` (faint watermark
  ordinal), `concept_equation` (ZINE=MAGAZINE word-equation), `pull_quote`/`standfirst`, `cta_button`/
  `cta_pair`, `status_stamp`/`corner_tab`, `spec_card`, `year_badge`, `gradient_rule` (2-stop brand rule),
  `catalogue_frame` (double-line specimen frame — museum/eastern presets).
- **Micro-viz:** `dot_meter` (●●○), `tradeoff_list` (+/−), `segmented_bar` (cumulative 100%), `meter_bar`
  (a single percentile/share/progress row — track + accent fill + a value label **vertically centered on
  the bar**; use this instead of hand-building "track box + fill box + number", which is how value labels
  end up floating off the bar's centerline; canvas-safe by construction — an overflowing value
  auto-shortens the bar instead of leaving the slide).
- **Photo on-brand (`scripts/image_fx.py`):** `duotone` / `grayscale` so a colour photo doesn't fight
  the accent (riso/brutalist/ink/luxury/museum), then `picture(fit="cover")`.

If the user gave a **style example** (Q4),
build to your **style brief** of it *per the chosen mimic mode* (`references/style-analysis.md`) —
**Mode A:** match its palette/accents, density, title treatment, and figure/table/equation motifs
(override the deckkit defaults to suit); **Mode B:** recreate its structure, density, and the 2–4
borrowed components + signature motif, but keep the topic-fit palette/type already locked in the
Step-2 design plan — do NOT carry the example's colours.
A few rules that matter (see `references/design-principles.md`):
- **Use the source's own figures, WHOLE — integral is the default.** For *any* deck
  (research, work, exec, teaching): if the source — paper, report, doc, existing slide, or a
  chart already produced from the code/data — has a figure (architecture, results, a plot),
  use *that*; don't redraw it (slow, risks wrong detail) and don't chop it into pieces. Many users
  *prefer* the whole figure even when it's dense (it's the artifact they know and trust), so
  when a figure feels too busy, your *first* move is to give it a whole slide — large, with an
  **assertion title + a one-line caption** pointing attention to the part that matters (e.g.
  "the orange line is this quarter", or "rightmost column is ours") — not to crop it down. Reach for cropping only to (a) **trim**
  surrounding page header / caption / whitespace (leaving a small margin, never flush), or (b) lift
  **one cleanly-separable sub-figure** that genuinely stands alone. Chopping a multi-panel figure into a few columns
  *loses context and changes what the authors showed* — do it only when the whole is truly
  unusable on a slide, and prefer to **confirm with the user** before discarding panels.
  Build native diagrams only for structure with no source figure.

  - **Cropping, PDF extraction (`extract_pdf.py`), the see-it `crop_helper.py` loop, and panel-grid reassembly → `references/asset-production.md` §Figures. Read it IN FULL before you crop, trim, or extract any figure**, including from a PDF — it holds the three 🔴 crop rules (crop the whole SEMANTIC object; the auto-detected bbox is only the plot panel; zoom each of the four edges afterwards), the rule that a legend you add on the slide does NOT substitute for the figure's own axis labels, and the never-crop-blind loop.

- **Animated results (embedding + sparingly generating GIFs), turning raw data into the RIGHT chart type (editable native vs raster; non-Latin = native, no tofu), and computing a REAL domain visual — plus the plot-must-render-correctly rules (dense sampling, legend never over the data, always view the PNG) → `references/asset-production.md` §Charts, GIFs, and computed domain visuals. Read it before you produce any chart, GIF, or computed image.**

- **Generated visual plates (atmosphere / conceptual) — by taste & purpose, opt-in; full mechanics in
  `references/image-generation.md`.** Generate where it genuinely helps (no quota), styled to the deck;
  **never bake words/numbers/labels/charts/logos into a plate** (those stay editable objects / real
  assets). **Each plate must be *highly topical* — depict THIS slide's actual subject, not a generic
  "fancy" image that could sit on any slide** (name what it shows, else cut). **Place plates
  consistently — never a one-off generated *header* on a single body slide** (title chrome is
  `title_bar`'s; a content plate goes full-bleed / side-panel / inline, one role + art-direction across
  the plated slides). Generate with **no key** (auto-detect the FREE rungs: native imagegen →
  `generate_images_codex.py`; build the manifest with `image_prompts.py`). The OpenAI-API path is
  **metered and gated** — an available key is not consent; ask first (🔴 `image-generation.md`
  BILLING GATE), keep assets in
  `~/Downloads/<deck>/assets/generated/`, place with `deckkit.picture(fit="contain"|"cover")`, and
  render-check (calm space behind text, no pseudo-text/fake charts, subject whole, real things right).

- **Brand logo / wordmark on every page (single-entity decks: real mark → `deckkit.wordmark` → ask; never a faked replica) and the SVG icon family (ONE open-licensed family, palette-recolored, the treatments, the rule-of-thumb + five quality marks) → `references/asset-production.md` §Brand logo and the SVG icon family. Read it before you place a logo or the first icon.** Craft detail also lives in the untouched `references/icons.md` / `references/image-generation.md` (routing table rows above).

- **Speaker notes — for a PRESENTED deck, put the spoken script in the notes, not on the slide.**
  For any deck the user will *present* (especially a conference talk, defense, or lecture), move the
  full sentences off the slide into speaker notes with `deckkit.speaker_notes(slide, "…")`.
  The slide shows the phrase; the notes hold what the presenter says. **The notes text comes from
  the content plan's Spoken thread — pipe it, don't re-draft** (the planner's VOICE PASS and claim
  ledger already covered it; a builder-invented narration bypasses both). Notes don't render on
  the slide, but the lint measures them (the DECK STATS `notes` column + the `NO NOTES` warn) and
  ships them to the critics in its `--json` — they also show in Presenter View and on printed
  Notes Pages, so the user can rehearse without the slide becoming a wall of text. Offer this at
  hand-off; it directly serves the "few words per point" rule. **For a read-alone deck there is no
  presenter** — the explanatory prose belongs **on the slide** (a reader won't open the notes), so
  keep the sentences visible there rather than hiding them in notes.
- **Layout & diagrams — full rules in `references/design-principles.md`; the essentials:**
  keep a `deckkit.GUTTER` (~0.4 in) between elements and clear of the footer; build **balanced
  split panels** and **equal-gap stacks** from one grid — `columns(n)` (horizontal) / `rows(n)`
  (vertical), with symmetric outer margins (an intentional asymmetric split still keeps equal
  outer margins, and don't strand a narrow element in a too-wide column); point
  `arrow(direction=…)` the way the flow moves (down/up between stacked boxes), keep repeated
  connectors evenly spaced and adjacent blocks **gapped with a clearly visible gap (≥ ~⅓ `GUTTER`, never near-touching)** — derive the stack pitch from `rows`/`vstack`, not a pitch that barely clears the block height — and centre a lone
  glyph in its box; place figures/plates with **`picture(..., fit="contain")`** so the subject
  is never cropped (`cover` only for edge-tolerant texture).
- **Never hand-pick a y for an auto-growing block — measure or anchor.** A bottom callout
  placed at an eyeballed low `y` grows *down* into the footer when its text wraps (the #1
  recurring layout bug). Use **`bottom_callout()`** (anchors to the footer band, grows up),
  get the safe region from **`content_band()`**, and pack content-height blocks with
  **`vstack(..., bottom=…)`** (equal gaps + no overlap by construction, errors at build time on
  overflow). Use `measure_callout/measure_bullets/measure_text` when you must position manually.
  Then run the Step-5 render self-check.
  - **Those measurements are CALIBRATED against the renderer in CI, and that is why you can lean
    on them.** Everything here trusts one number — how wide the renderer will set this string —
    and when that number drifted narrow (bold text in font-collection families measured at
    regular width, 3.9% short), every guard built on it silently PASSED while the text wrapped
    anyway: a caption sized for one line put its second line on top of a footer, and the lint
    agreed with the build because both were computed from the same wrong number. The regression
    checks render real strings and compare the ink against the prediction, one-sided and tight on the
    side that hurts: the measurement may be a little conservative, never optimistic. So trust it
    to the inch — and still keep a real gap, because an estimate that is *correct* is not the
    same as one with margin.
  - **Reserve the bottom callout's space BEFORE sizing content above it — don't add it last.**
    `bottom_callout()` returns its TOP y; the recurring mistake is to hardcode tall panels/cards
    (e.g. `y=1.7, h=2.5`) and *then* drop a callout on top, so the bar overlaps the cards' bottom
    edge. Call the callout FIRST, then size content to end **a full `GUTTER` above** its returned
    top: `top = dk.bottom_callout(s, 0.6, W-1.2, "要点", "…"); card_h = top - GUTTER - card_y`. A
    *near-zero* overlap is not harmless — the bar draws on top and **clips the cards' rounded
    corners** — so require a visible gap, not just non-collision. (The build-time lint now warns
    **`SLIVER_GAP`** on panel-on-panel grazing — a 0.005–0.10in seam between panels or a panel and
    a picture — and the Step-5 render self-check still eyeballs the seam; reserving the space by
    construction remains the fix, the warn is the net.)
- **Never hand-pick an x for a LABEL either — derive it from the thing the label names.** The
  y-rule above has an x-twin, and it is the more common miss because nothing crashes: a caption,
  a tag, a unit, a legend key, an axis note is *positioned* rather than *anchored*, and it lands
  near its subject instead of on it. Every such element gets its x from one of exactly three
  sources — the same grid column as its subject, its subject's own measured edge, or its
  subject's centre — and never from an offset nudged off a neighbour until it "fits". **Two
  measured failures, one class:**
  - *Caption on the wrong grid.* A four-panel figure is ONE picture, so its panels have no shape
    geometry to align to; the captions went onto the text grid (`ML + i*CW/4`) while the panels
    sat where matplotlib put them, at **unequal widths** — each panel keeps its own aspect ratio,
    so equal quarters are wrong by construction. Fix: have the plotting script export each
    panel's span as a fraction of the figure (`ax.images[0].get_window_extent()` after
    `fig.canvas.draw()`, over `fig.get_window_extent().width`) and place captions from the
    picture's *placed* rect — `dk.picture` returns the shape, so `pic.left/914400` is the real x
    after `fit="contain"` letterboxing. Backstopped by the **`CAPTION NOT ALIGNED`** render lint.
  - *A tag nudged into a corner.* A Chinese gloss for an English product name was placed at
    `(mx + 1.46, yy + 0.24)` — past the end of the rule, above the next row — giving one unit
    three left edges and four baselines, so the eye could not tell what it belonged to. Fix: an
    apposition is not a separate element. Same paragraph, same baseline, one left edge:
    `[[(name, …, FONT), ("　", …), (tag, …, EAFONT)]]`.

  The general rule behind both: **an element that annotates another element is not free to be
  anywhere.** If you find yourself adding a constant to make a label sit nicely, the constant is
  the bug — ask what edge it should share and compute that instead. Only the caption case has a
  lint; the rest is on you, which is why it is also PRE-FLIGHT 9.
- **🔴 Gate the geometry at BUILD time — end the build script with `dk.lint_layout(prs, strict=True)`
  before `prs.save()`.** `strict=True` makes it a *real* gate: an unresolved CRITICAL **raises and the
  deck is never saved**, so you can't accidentally ship a broken layout to the render/critic (plain
  `lint_layout(prs)` only *prints* and relies on you noticing — use it only when you deliberately want a
  non-blocking report, e.g. a known off-canvas bleed). This is the cheapest place to catch
  the mechanical layout faults: it runs in-process in milliseconds, *before* the slow render +
  visual-critic round, and walks **every** shape — however it was placed, the grid helpers or raw
  coordinates — reasoning about each label's **ink** rectangle (where the glyphs actually land), so it
  stays quiet on the generously-sized frames real builds use. It **hard-fails (CRITICAL)** on five
  things: content (text ink / a card / a non-bleed image) **off-canvas**, text **overflowing** a visible
  box, **text-on-text** overlap, a **connector routed through a block** (`CONNECTOR_IN_BOX`), a **decorative RULE
  drawn through a text block's ink** (`RULE_THROUGH_TEXT` — a divider/hairline placed at a hand-picked `y`
  that the text above it later grew into; derive the rule from the block's measured end, never a guessed
  coordinate), **CJK runs with no `<a:ea>` font** (`CJK_NO_EA` — set
  `deckkit.EAFONT` before building; catching it here saves the render round-trip lint_deck previously
  needed), and **CJK runs with no `<a:ea>` font** (`CJK_NO_EA` — set
  `deckkit.EAFONT` before building; catching it here saves the render round-trip lint_deck previously
  needed); it **warns** on **display numerals in an old-style figure face** (`OLDSTYLE_FIGURES` — digits at mixed heights make a big number visibly bob; the figure components resolve a lining face themselves via `deckkit.numeral_run_face`, so this fires only on hand-set runs — a taste call, deliberately not a build blocker), on a label/figure **escaping its card**, a **single
  line left off-centre** in a card, content **reaching the footer**, and **two panels nearly
  touching** (`SLIVER_GAP` — a 0.005–0.10in seam between panels, or a panel and a picture: the
  hand-picked-pitch bug). (Each code's plain-language meaning + first fix:
  `references/troubleshooting-faq.md` §4.) Every CRITICAL it prints is real *when the deck's fonts are
  installed* — when a font is substituted for measurement it says so and carries ~1 line of slack
  (conservative, may under-flag), so it never fabricates. It is a **net, not a substitute for
  looking** (it can't see contrast, z-order, a figure smothering text, or shapes inside groups — the
  critic's job). The **layout contract** below maps to it as: the lint *enforces* rules 1 & 3 (off-canvas
  + text-on-text as CRITICALs) and *warns* on 5 (off-centre) and footer; the rest (padding, fit,
  grid-gap, diagram-bbox-first) it doesn't check — the named helpers satisfy those *by construction*, so
  you rarely trip the net in the first place:
  1. **Stay in the safe area** — get the rect from `content_band()`; only full-bleed hero/divider art bleeds. (On a provided/registered template, pass `content_band(slide, top=<the template's title-band bottom>)` so the safe rect honours the template's own header/footer instead of the deckkit default.)
  2. **Give text padding** — inset every label ≥0.1in inside its card (`cx+0.2`, width `cw-0.4`); flush-to-edge reads as a mistake.
  3. **No text-on-text** — one column/stack owns each region; never drop a second text box into the same rectangle.
  4. **If it doesn't fit, resolve it** — `fit_text_size(runs, w, h, start)` gives the largest size that fits; else shorten or grow the box.
  5. **Text in a *self-contained* block → equal top/bottom padding (vertically centre it)** — anchor it `MIDDLE` over the block's own rect: draw the block, then place the text at that block's exact `(x, y, w, h)` with `anchor=MSO_ANCHOR.MIDDLE` (wrap this as a small deck helper so centring is automatic, not per-call), whether it's one line or several. Placing text at a **hand-picked y-offset inside a fixed-height block** is the recurring "the takeaway text is closer to the top edge than the bottom" bug — the padding must be equal *by construction*, not eyeballed (the `OFFCENTER` warn fires on a lone-line card). *Carve:* a one-line reading column that must top-align with a taller sibling column under a shared header stays top-anchored (alignment beats centring).
  6. **Grid/stack over hand-picked y, and leave a real gap (~`GUTTER`)** — *and this includes the
     DIVIDERS between blocks: a hairline at a guessed `y` is crossed by the text above it the moment
     that text is edited and wraps one line further. Derive it (`rule_y = stack_end + pad`, where
     `stack_end` comes from the loop that drew the stack), which `RULE_THROUGH_TEXT` now enforces.* — `columns()/rows()` for equal panels, `vstack(…, bottom=…)` for content-height blocks (no overlap, even gaps by construction), `content_band()` for the vertical extent. (On a provided template, the layout's **placeholders** already anchor content — these helpers are the no-template path; fill placeholders where the template gives them.)
  7. **For a diagram, compute all bounding boxes first, then draw into them** — lay out the rects (and reserve arrow channels), *then* place nodes/labels — never eyeball one shape against the previous one.
- **Colour.** Rotate `deckkit.ACCENTS` so diagrams aren't monotone; reserve magenta
  for emphasis. For a **sequence of blocks** (chips / cards / pipeline stages) give each a
  **distinct, deliberately-contrasted hue** via `deckkit.palette(n, ACCENTS)` — it returns `n`
  distinct fills and **warns if any two adjacent blocks aren't visibly different**; never reuse a
  hue for adjacent blocks and **never use a neutral gray as a category colour** (gray reads as
  disabled, not a category — it makes a coloured row look half-finished). **Bind each hue to ONE
  concept deck-wide** (the accent = the proposed method, or "risk", or one product) — a colour that
  means the same thing on every slide is the biggest "this deck is credible" move: see
  `references/semantic-color-contract.md`. **🔴 A hue used as TEXT must itself clear ≥4.5:1 on its
  background** — a vivid gold / coral / lime that looks great as a fill can render at 2–4:1 as small
  label/kicker/emphasis text on a light surface (invisible-ish), the recurring "the coloured text is
  too faint" bug. So keep TWO tokens per accent when needed: a **bright fill-only** variant (rules,
  bars, icon tiles, header bands) and a **darker text-safe** variant (`contrast_ratio(...) ≥ 4.5`)
  for any run set in that colour — verify each bound hue's *text* value with `deckkit.contrast_ratio`
  at design time, not just the fill. **The same split covers a MARK ON A FILLED GROUND — an icon
  glyph on its tile, a symbol/number on a coloured chip, an arrowhead on a band — which must clear the
  WCAG non-text bar ~3:1 against *that ground*, not just against the slide.** The classic misses are a
  same-hue pair (a teal glyph on an aqua tile) and a dark-on-dark pair (a coloured glyph on a
  near-black tile) — both invisible. `deckkit.icon_tile` guards this by construction: it reads the
  icon's ink from the PNG (or takes an explicit `glyph=<colour>`) and auto-nudges the tile to ≥3:1, so
  **prefer `icon_tile` over hand-placing an icon on a raw `box`**; when you compose a mark on a fill by
  hand, pick it with `deckkit.contrast_ratio(mark, ground) ≥ 3` (or invert to white / near-black). Name the closing slide
  for its purpose, in the deck's language ("Conclusion" for an English talk; 结论/总结 on a Chinese deck).
- **Accessibility.** Keep text ≥4.5:1 on its fill (`contrast_ratio`; `chip`/`modbox`
  auto-pick a readable text colour) and never encode meaning by colour alone. Set
  **alt-text** on every informative figure — `deckkit.alt_text(shape, "one-line
  description")` after `add_picture()` — for screen readers; it doesn't render (invisible
  to the critic) so make it a build habit. More in `references/design-principles.md`.

- **Equations & inline math symbols → `references/asset-production.md` §Equations and inline math. Read it IN FULL the moment the deck needs any formula, variable, or math glyph** — it holds the 🔴 editable-`equation_native`-by-default rule and the `equation_png` 2-D carve, the math-font dependency to flag at hand-off (`references/deck-setup.md` §Fonts owns the font itself), formula sizing, the never-Unicode-super/subscript rule, and transcribe-from-paper / derive-from-code fidelity.

- **One language.** Keep the whole deck in the chosen target language — don't drift
  (no stray English on a Chinese deck, no English headings over translated bullets).
  Technical terms / proper nouns / acronyms / units / code may stay original; only
  build mixed/bilingual decks when the user asked (`references/multilingual.md`).

Copy `references/examples/build_example_generic.py` (brand-free) — or a registered
template's own `build_example.py` — for how the helpers compose. **For the single-author path,
copy its per-slide-function scaffold too** (STYLE block → one function per slide with a plan-row
docstring `role=… | form=… | build:…/static:… | takeaway='…'` → an ordered `SLIDES` registry →
`main()`): the docstrings make plan↔code correspondence greppable instead of remembered, and it
does not change "build the whole deck in one script run" — `main()` always builds every slide.

**Scaling up — section fan-out for large decks (optional).** For a normal deck
(~6–14 slides), one author writing one build script is both faster and more coherent —
**that's the default** (and stays the single-author default up to ~14 slides). Only fan
out when it genuinely pays: **large decks (15+ slides)** or **independently-sourced sections**
(different papers/datasets/areas). The
rule that keeps quality high: **centralize coherence, parallelize only the independent
work.** The coordinator (you) keeps the comprehension brief, the arc, and a single
shared `style.py` (palette/font/chrome — copy `references/examples/style_example.py`);
then dispatch **one subagent per *section* (not per slide)** in parallel, each
importing that `style` and exposing `build_section(prs)` (copy
`references/examples/section_example.py`), each self-rendering its own section to
optimize it; finally `scripts/assemble.py` runs them in order into **one** deck (no
fragile .pptx merging). Don't do one-agent-per-slide-with-neighbour-chat — it drifts,
fights the single-file artifact, and doesn't speed up the parts that actually cost
time. Full workflow (incl. the critic panel + finding-routing) in
`references/large-deck-orchestration.md`.

**Motion & builds — the animation that matters is in-slide "appear" builds, NOT slide transitions.**
🔴 **Do not "animate" a deck by putting a fade transition on every slide — that adds nothing and is the
lazy mistake to avoid.** What "add animation" means here is **revealing a slide's content one beat at a
time on click** (an *appear* build) so the audience follows the speaker instead of reading ahead.
**Builds are the USER's opt-in choice** (the interview asks it on presented decks; see Step 0) — this
section is about how to build them WELL *once the user has opted in*; if they opted out, the deck is
static and that is correct, not a missing must. The two layers are **not** equal:
- **(1) In-slide appear builds — THE real work, WHEN the user opted in.** *You* decide WHERE (which
  slides earn a staged reveal): reach for it wherever stepping the reveal will *emphasize*, *engage*,
  or *guide* — a multi-point list, a **pipeline / multi-stage diagram** (stage at a time), a
  **multi-part argument**, **before→after**, **evidence→takeaway**. Leave title / divider /
  single-image / scan-all-at-once slides plain. Not every slide needs a build (a plain stretch is
  fine) — but **a slide that DOES get a build is staged FULLY**: 🔴 **every content element on it is
  assigned to a build step and reveals in a deliberate reading order — never animate some blocks while
  the rest sit pre-shown from frame 0** (the "half-animated slide" is the exact weirdness to avoid).
  The static base holds ONLY the persistent scaffold — the title/header + any frame, axes, or
  always-true context the beats land on; everything that is *content to be paced* begins hidden and
  accumulates. Group the shapes of one thought into one step (a box *and* its arrow reveal together).
- **(2) Slide-to-slide transition — optional, secondary, off the critical path.** A calm deck-wide
  `slide_transition(s, "fade")` is *allowed* but never the point; a deck with **no** transition and good
  appear-builds beats one with a fade on every slide and no builds. Decide it once; **don't count
  "added transitions" as having animated the deck.**

Use `scripts/anim.py`: draw ONLY the persistent scaffold outside steps, then wrap **each content beat**
(the first one included) in a `Build.step()` — one bullet/block/stage per step, in reading order, so the
content area opens EMPTY and fills in click by click — then `apply(effect="appear")` (instant) or
`"fade"` (soft). Recipe in `references/animation.md` ("bread-and-butter build" + "full staged reveal").
A slide must still read correctly **fully-built** (for print/PDF) — builds layer on a correct static
slide, never fix a cluttered one.

**Record a one-line motion manifest** as you go — for each slide, `build: <what reveals,
in order>` or `static: <why nothing to pace>`, plus whether the deck-wide transition is on.
You'll hand this to the critic in step 5 (it can't *see* motion in a static render, so it
judges your motion *design* from this manifest plus the build-candidates it spots in the
pixels). **The canonical home is the per-slide function docstrings** (the scaffold above — the
`build:`/`static:` line lives in each slide's docstring and is handed to the critic as-is); a
comment block in `build_<deck>.py` remains the fallback for template-specific build_examples
that don't use the scaffold.

### 🔴 PRE-FLIGHT — tick these 12 before the first render, EVERY deck, no exceptions
*(The Step-4 SIGNATURE PROOF is not "the first render" in this sense — it is a one-slide probe of a
deck that does not exist yet, so most of these 12 have nothing to check. Run the ones that apply to
that single slide (legibility, no placeholder text, lining figures), and run the full 12 before the
first WHOLE-deck render as always.)*
This is the fixed boarding-pass between build and render. **Emit it as twelve literal ✓/✗ lines** (in
your working notes or the build script's tail comment) — writing the ticks is what forces the checks
to actually run; a deck with un-ticked pre-flight items is not ready to render. It exists because
these are the rules that history shows get *silently* skipped when they live only as prose — they are
judgment calls the render-time lint cannot measure (lint already covers: word load, ink coverage,
font drama, build presence, layout sameness, CJK ea-font, contrast, footer, overlaps — don't re-tick
those here; read its report instead).
1. **Speaker notes**: presented deck (screen-shared = presented) → every slide's notes = the plan's **Spoken thread, verbatim**, via `dk.speaker_notes` (deviations — e.g. a split/merged slide — noted in one clause); self-read → prose is ON the slides instead.
2. **Builds — opted-in? then FULLY staged**: builds appear only if the user opted in; every animated slide reveals ALL its content beats in order (nothing content-bearing pre-shown but the title/frame — no half-animated slide), starting from an empty content area (first beat included), with no spoiling summary/legend in the base.
3. **Plan↔code correspondence**: (a) mechanical — diff the design plan's per-slide rows against the slide-function docstrings (icon family included; the classic inline-mode miss); (b) spot-check — each `build:` docstring has matching `Build.step` calls in its function body; (c) **cover carries its promises** — the built cover shows the self-verify-(l) device, the motif's label/legend where the plan said the STRANGER TEST is satisfied by labeling, and the `logo plan:` asset placed as planned (official file untouched; on a single-entity deck a cover with no logo and no recorded `n/a` reason is a ✗).
4. **Charts native**: every chart is editable-native unless a matplotlib look was deliberately chosen; legends sit off the data. Same bar for math: every 1-D equation is `equation_native`; raster `equation_png` only for genuinely 2-D layout (fractions/matrices), named as such.
5. **Evidence real**: every domain image/figure is the real computed/source artifact — no plausible stand-in; PDF crops checked on all four edges; every SOURCED photo comes from a sanctioned origin (Commons / Openverse / press kit / user file), its subject verified against caption/geotag/category, it is **watermark-free** (a watermark is an unlicensed-preview tell → reject the file; never crop/blur/inpaint the mark away), its license recorded (credit placed where required), it is **aesthetically vetted** (an ugly / under-construction / blurry / unrepresentative shot is rejected even when the subject is correct → re-source, or generate a declared-stylized illustration via the `searched, found but low-quality → generated, flagged illustrative` rung), and it is palette-treated so mixed sources read as one deck; no generated CONTENT image claims photographic reality for a real-and-specific subject (REFERENT RULE, `references/image-generation.md` — generated-template identity plates and declared stylized illustrations are exempt; a real subject with no findable photo uses a recorded `searched, none found → …` rung). Any **text over a hero/photo/plate** is verified legible against the pixels — no image linework crosses the glyphs (a scrim only dims a bright line; cover it with a near-opaque panel), eyebrow/kicker included, with a clear title↔subtitle gap (render self-check "Text over an image").
6. **Colour keyed**: the semantic-colour ledger's meanings are taught on-slide (key at first use) and no accent appears outside its bound meaning; chrome stays quiet — the **loud** signature motif ≤3 appearances (a *quiet register signature* — faint grid/scanline, corner numeral, edge rule, small seal — MAY repeat on every slide; that is SYSTEM, not stamping) — AND the chosen preset's `guard` constraints hold on every slide (quote the guard line in the tick).
6b. **Register carries all pages (的风格要走所有页)**: the quiet register signature reaches ordinary interior slides, not just the cover/dividers — the `interior register:` contract cue is present on interiors, or a `none (flat by register — <reason>)` carve is recorded. A style dressed only on the bookends fails.
7. **Claims current**: every time-bound ledger row re-verified with as-of = TODAY; the deck carries its "as of" date.
8. **Language & hygiene**: one language throughout; zero meta-annotations ("placeholder"/"TODO"/"AI-generated"); voice pass done on every line.
9. **Eye path & anchoring**: squint each slide — first look lands on the named hero, 3–4 hierarchy levels survive the blur. Then, un-squinted, **name the anchor of every label** — caption, tag, unit, legend key, axis note: which edge does it share with the thing it names (its subject's left / centre / right, or the same grid column)? **List the slides that carry labels and the anchor each uses.** A label whose x is a constant nobody can justify is the defect; `CAPTION NOT ALIGNED` only backstops the captions-under-panels case, and every other label on the deck has no lint at all.
10. **Hand-off ready**: font/portability deps + per-slide click order noted for the hand-off; open questions carried, not dropped; output dir resolved + announced (`~/Downloads/<deck>/` or the user's stated choice); image licenses/credits noted (sourced photos).
11. **Titles bound to takeaways**: every content slide's title IS the plan's takeaway or a compression keeping its subject + verb + claim; **list the slide numbers** of compressions and of noted exceptions (bare topic labels are fine on cover/divider/agenda/closing; a named exception covers: Mode A "match its title treatment", a registered user template with a fixed title register, or a slide whose planned takeaway demonstrably lands as its named hero / `insight_banner` / `takeaway_rail` — note which element carries it). Emitting the slide numbers, not just a ✓, is what forces the per-slide comparison.
12. **Form diversity & frame fill — EMIT THE TALLY**: **first run
    `python scripts/component_audit.py build_<deck>.py <deck>.pptx` and paste its two summary lines
    into the tick** (it takes ~50ms and reads the finished file, so it costs nothing and cannot be
    guessed). It states one fact — how many of the form components it can name a guarantee for this
    deck actually called (deckkit's wider form catalogue is ~59) — and points at clusters whose
    geometry matches a component the deck never used. **If it prints `NOT CHECKED`, the tick is not
    done**: a wrong path or an unreadable deck exits 1 and says so, rather than reporting clean.
    **It is ADVISORY BY DESIGN and must never be treated as a blocker:** geometry cannot tell a lazy
    hand-roll from a deliberate bespoke composition, and the deliberate one is the *signature move*.
    So for each cluster, either reach for the component, or write the one clause that makes the
    hand-roll a decision ("the track is the deck's motif — a meter_bar would centre the value and
    kill the gap"). *(Why this tick exists, measured: across three delivered decks the build scripts
    called 3 of 59 form components. Every other form was composed from raw box+text, re-inheriting
    the geometry bugs — a baseline short of the last bar, a value label off the bar's centreline —
    that the components were written to fix. SKILL.md had said "when a COMPONENT exists, BUILD that
    component" as prose for a long time; it was violated dozens of times and detected zero times.)*
    Then write the deck's form-family tally as one literal line (`cards/panels: N · diagram: N · chart/proportional: N · big-type/editorial: N · timeline/roadmap: N · hero-image: N …`) and check six things against it: (a) **no family >~40% of content slides** — a first draft's greedy default is the card/panel, and per-slide checks can't see deck-level sameness, so this tally is the one place the crutch becomes visible; (b) every slide whose content is a RATIO / FLIP / DIVISION / PROCESS uses the form that *shows* it (a proportional bar, a topology diagram, a split, a roadmap), not a box that states it; (c) each interior slide **fills its frame** — a slide whose content ends in the top half either gets enriched, merged with its neighbour, or names its deliberate quiet register in one clause; (d) **one canvas system** — no background value/colour flip landing on exactly one interior slide (a flip must recur as a divider family or bookend; on the generated-template branch the plate stays on every content page and rhythm comes from imagery strength — `ONE-OFF CANVAS FLIP` lint is the render-time backstop); (e) **icons where content is categorical** — list the slides whose content names tools/entities/roles/pillars/categories; each such slide carries the planned icon family (one family, palette-recolored) or a one-clause waiver — "opt-in" never waives this silently (self-verify (g)); (f) **architecture rotation** — emit a second one-line tally of each content slide's TAKEAWAY SLOT (bottom-strip / side-rail / inline / headline / none) and CONTAINMENT (panelled / direct-on-canvas): no single takeaway slot on more than ~half the content slides (a bottom strip on every page is a template tell — `BOTTOM-STRIP MONOCULTURE` lint backstops it), and on a calm canvas at least ~1/3 of content slides put their protagonist directly on the canvas, un-panelled. Emitting the tallies + the (b)/(c)/(d)/(e)/(f) slide numbers, not just a ✓, is what forces the deck-level look a slide-by-slide build never takes.

**Gates never collapse.** A quick / low-stakes / inline run scales the *size* of each artifact
(a 5-line content plan, a 10-line design plan), never the *existence* of the gates: interview →
content plan → design plan (with self-verify) → pre-flight → lint+stats → critic. Every rule-miss
this skill has shipped happened when a step was run "in my head" instead of emitted — if it isn't
written down, it didn't happen. **The auto-waiver/inline path is where this bites hardest:** with
no checkpoint audience, the build slides into a single greedy pass that reaches for the same
handy component on every slide and stops at "nothing's broken" — every gate above is a floor, and
only the emitted form-candidates (per-slide runner-up from a different family) + the PRE-FLIGHT 12
tally push toward the ceiling. A delegated deck emits them for itself, not for the user.

## Step 5 — Render, verify, then run the actor–critic loop
**You should already have run the build-time geometry gate** (`dk.lint_layout(prs)` at the end of
Step 4) and cleared its CRITICALs (off-canvas · overflow · text-on-text) in-process, so the render
loop starts mostly geometry-clean. `lint_deck.py` below then re-checks that geometry on the final file
as a backstop and adds the render/parse-only faults; the rest is what needs real pixels (crop,
contrast, balance, a tofu glyph, text on a busy image), which only the render shows.

**Iterating on a deck you already rendered? Add `--fast`.** `render_deck … --fast` fingerprints
every slide (its XML + rels + the bytes of the media it references, mixed with a deck-global digest
covering the theme/master/layouts/canvas size) against the previous run, then re-renders **only the
slides that changed** — it subsets the pptx to those slides, converts that, and overwrites just their
PNGs. Measured on an 18-slide deck: a full render is ~12s, a one-slide change is **~4.7s**, and a run
where nothing changed is **0.07s**. Output is byte-identical to a full render (verified), so the
critic and the render-time lint see exactly what they would have seen anyway. It falls back to a full
render — and says why — whenever the mapping could be wrong: slide count changed, every slide changed,
no cache, or the deck contains **auto slide-number fields** or **hidden slides** (LibreOffice drops
hidden slides from the PDF, so page N stops being slide N — a full render now warns loudly and
refuses to cache when the page count and slide count disagree). **Use it for the actor-critic fix rounds
and for post-delivery tweaks** ("change slide 7 to a chart"); use a plain full render for the first
render of a deck and whenever you pass `--deliverables`.

First **render and look** (`bash scripts/render_deck.sh <deck.pptx>` → one PNG per
slide). python-pptx writes blind — overflow, low contrast, a callout on the footer,
or a missing glyph only show up in the image. Fix mechanical issues and re-render.
(First time on a machine, or a render errors? `bash scripts/check_env.sh` verifies
LibreOffice + the python deps and prints the fix for anything missing.)
**When anything in this step fails or flags** — a build exception, a lint finding you don't
immediately recognize, a render that produces nothing — open `references/troubleshooting-faq.md`
first: it maps every error surface (build exceptions · `lint_layout` codes · render failures ·
`lint_deck` findings · `[stats]` act-or-accept guidance) to symptom → cause → first fix. And when
you surface a finding to the user (in a checkpoint, FYI, or hand-off), say it in that page's
plain language — *what broke, why, and the fix applied or proposed* — never as a raw lint code
the user would need documentation to decode.
**Codex sandbox note:** LibreOffice may abort or produce no PDF when launched inside a managed
sandbox even though `check_env.py` passes; in that case rerun only the render command with elevated /
unsandboxed execution, then continue the normal render -> lint -> critic loop. This is an environment
permission issue, not evidence that the deck is malformed.

**Then run the layout lint** — `python scripts/lint_deck.py <deck.pptx>` (add `--json out.json` for a structured copy of findings + the stats block — hand THAT to dispatched critics instead of re-parsing console text; the lint auto-reads the `./render` PNGs beside the deck to add the colour/value-pacing row + the `FLAT RHYTHM` warn, or pass `--renders <dir>` — silently skipped when no renders exist, so it never changes a render-less run). `render_deck.sh` also emits `render/thumb_first.png` + `thumb_last.png` (~240px) for the critic's poster test. The build-time
`dk.lint_layout` (Step 4) already cleared the pure-geometry faults *before* this render; **lint_deck.py
is its render-time complement** — it re-checks geometry on the FINAL file and adds the faults that only
the rendered/parsed deck reveals (which `lint_layout` deliberately leaves to it). A cheap, deterministic
check, it flags **invisible/low-contrast text against its backing fill (an uncoloured run defaults to black and vanishes on a dark card), off-slide overflow, text overflowing the card behind it, uneven card heights in a
row, two solid blocks/images overlapping (neither contained), footer collisions, orphaned punctuation
/ widow (a lone 。/，or single glyph on the last line — 避头尾), CJK text with no EA font (the kinsoku
root cause), whole-page-image (editability), and orphan/empty slides**: exactly the failures the eye
misses (a callout tucked under a panel; a 2-line body hanging below a card; a 。 stranded on its own row). Fix every finding, re-render, and re-lint
to clean before handing to the critic. It also prints soft **`[warn]`s** (advisory, non-blocking) for
what the hard families can't fail on: **missing alt-text** on an informative image, a **math-font
tofu** risk (an `equation_native` font not installed on the render host), **LOW/BODY CONTRAST**
bands (1.8–4.5:1), **grouped-only content**, and the **accessibility set** — NO SLIDE TITLE /
DUPLICATE SLIDE TITLES / READING ORDER (screen-reader navigation) and NON-TEXT CONTRAST (WCAG
1.4.11 for icons/lines). Resolve them or consciously accept them (FAQ §7). The hard families also
include **TEXT ON IMAGE** — a render-pixel contrast estimate (<1.5:1) for text sitting on a
photo/gradient with no opaque backing, exactly the class solid-fill contrast checks can't see;
its 1.5–3.0 band is the TEXT-ON-IMAGE CONTRAST `[warn]`.

**It then prints a DECK STATS block — the measured form of the design targets. READ it, don't skim
past it** (pass `--selfread` for a read-alone deck — it raises the TEXT WALL budget (~40→~90 words)
and drops the presented-only SMALL TYPE / NO BUILDS warns; the other warns are mode-independent —
`--surface` for a poster/single-canvas artifact, `--textheavy` when the user explicitly chose
text-heavy density for a presented deck, or `--static` on a presented deck when the user opted OUT of
appear-builds (silences NO BUILDS — a static presented deck was their choice, not an omission), so the
budgets fit the delivery mode). Per slide it measures:
reading **load** (latin words + CJK chars/2) vs the ~40-word presented budget · **text% / ink%
coverage** vs the ~50–70% whitespace target · **max font pt** · shape/picture/chart counts ·
**build** presence · **sim↑** (layout-skeleton similarity vs the previous slide); deck-wide it
prints the **font histogram + type-drama ratio** and **builds/transitions n/N**. Its `[stats]`
warnings name the rule they measure — **`TEXT WALL`** (word budget blown → cut copy to notes or
split), **`CROWDED`** (occupancy past ~70% — role bands: cover 25–35 · exec 45–60 · technical 55–70 →
subtract or split, don't shrink), **`LAYOUT SAMENESS`**
(3 consecutive slides share one skeleton → the §1.2 skeleton-rotation rule failed), **`FLAT TYPE`**
(no typographic hero → the type-scale drama rule failed), **`SMALL TYPE`** (body-median under the
canvas-relative ≈18pt-equivalent floor → fewer words, bigger type), **`SIZE SPRAWL`** (>3–4 font sizes
on one slide → use the declared type-scale tokens), **`NO BUILDS`** (presented deck with no
appear-builds → the motion manifest failed *unless the user opted out of builds* — then pass
`--static`), **`SKELETON VARIETY`** (<4 distinct layout skeletons
across an 8+-slide deck → the canvas architecture barely rotates), **`TIMID COVER`** (slide 1's
largest run under 2× body → the cover lacks poster scale), **`FLAT RHYTHM`** (when render PNGs are
present via `--renders`/`./render`: no light/dark or colour-temperature event across the deck → the
rhythm map's Background-mode column is single-note), and on CJK decks **`CJK TIGHT LEADING`** (multi-line
CJK at ≤ single spacing → use the script-aware default) and **`CJK-LATIN SPACING`** (both 盘古之白
conventions mixed → pick one deck-wide). Treat each `[stats]` warning as the NAMED design rule
having failed measurably: fix it or write one clause of why this deck is the exception, and **paste
the stats block into the critic's input** so the judges score numbers, not impressions. It's a safety
net for the no-overlap / fits-its-box / density / rhythm rules, **not** a
replacement for looking (it can't judge crop, balance, legibility, or fidelity).

**🔴 When the gate says clean and the pixels say broken, the PIXELS win.** Paint order is the fault
class that keeps proving this: a shape added after a text box is drawn ON TOP of it while every
geometry check stays green. Three real decks shipped that way — a footer hairline over a sources
line, a 150-tile field erasing a caption, a dashed rule of 40 boxes struck through a footnote — and
each was found by a human looking at a PNG. The lesson was not "add another rule": the old check
enumerated *causes* (this shape type, painted then, covering that much), and causes are unbounded,
so every exclusion in it was a hole. `OCCLUSION` / `RULE THROUGH TEXT` now measure the **union** of
everything painted over a text block, so a thing built from many small parts cannot slip a
per-shape threshold; and `TEXT NOT VISIBLE` asks the one question with a bounded answer — *does
this line render any glyphs at all?* — straight from the pixels, so it catches a picture, a group,
a gradient or a same-colour-as-its-ground block without knowing which it was. Still a net, not a
proof. The model remains
blind to: **shapes inside groups** (imported SVG and user .pptx files on the redesign branch),
**chart interiors** (neither linter opens a chart part, so a bad number-format code renders raw),
**rotated shapes**, **text measured with a substituted font** (the lint says so and carries ~1 line
of slack), and anything **LibreOffice draws differently** from what the XML implies. A clean lint
means "nothing the model can see is wrong", never "the slide is right" — which is the entire reason
this scan exists and why it is not optional.

**Also read what the lint says it did NOT do.** With no renders beside the deck the pixel-backed
families disable themselves; the run now prints one `[skipped] … NOT checked: …` line and carries
`pixel_checks` in `--json`. `0 findings` with that line present is a different sentence from `0
findings` without it, and only one of them means what it looks like.

**Render self-check — scan EVERY slide for these before handing to the critic** (they're
invisible in the build code and only appear in the pixels; catching them yourself saves a
critic round — full rationale in `references/design-principles.md`):
- **Overflow / contrast / footer / glyphs** — no clipped or spilling text, ≥4.5:1 contrast,
  nothing jammed on the footer, no tofu/missing glyphs, and **no orphaned punctuation** (a lone 。/，
  or single glyph stranded on its own row — set `deckkit.EAFONT` so PowerPoint's kinsoku keeps it
  attached, and widen/reword if needed).
- **No build/meta annotation visible** — scan for any text that describes *how the slide was made*
  rather than its content: "（可点击编辑的原生图表）"/"(editable native chart)", "(AI-generated)", "(placeholder)",
  "(draft/草稿)", "generated by…", TODO/FIXME. It must NOT be on a slide — delete it (it belongs in code
  comments or the hand-off). A leaked meta-label ships broken.
- **Stacked groups read as separate** — for stacked labelled groups (stat label+value+caption, stacked
  cards), the gap *between* groups is clearly larger than the gaps *within* one (proximity); no caption
  crowding the next group's label.
- **Balance & suitable space** — every element has a comfortable margin on **all four sides**:
  nothing crowds an edge, nothing strands a big dead gap (the right *degree* — not too tight,
  not too loose). Split panels + flanking margins equal; no large dead-white band beside a
  narrow element; a **figure beside text is anchored to its margin (not centred-and-far-
  stranded)** with the text one gutter away; repeated blocks/connectors evenly spaced; grid-
  aligned, nothing lopsided. **A column/stack inside a card fills the space below its header** — a
  ladder, a list, stacked chips should **distribute evenly** to fill the available height; don't
  bottom-/top-anchor and strand a visible gap between the header and the first item (compute the gap
  from the region — `(region_h − n·item_h)/(n−1)` — or use `vstack`/`rows`, never a hand-picked offset).
  **And every label sits ON the thing it labels** — a caption centred on its own panel (not on the
  text column divided by N, which is wrong the moment the panels are unequal), a tag on its subject's
  baseline and left edge. A label sharing no edge with its subject reads as floating even though
  nothing overlaps and nothing overflows; PRE-FLIGHT 9 makes you name each anchor, and
  `CAPTION NOT ALIGNED` backstops only the captions-under-panels case.
- **Block padding & no inflated filler** — text inside a chip/card/callout hugs the box with a
  **modest, balanced** top/bottom margin (middle-anchored; not floating in a tall box, not cramped).
  A short card must not leave a white strip at the bottom. **No oversized block faking a full slide:**
  a single short line of small font swimming in a big box is a placeholder tell — either *add real
  content* to fill it or *shrink the box to hug the text* and use the freed space; never inflate a
  container to cover a gap.
- **Font hierarchy (content < title)** — body/content/callout/label text is **visibly smaller** than
  the slide title (clear step between levels, ~1.4–1.8×); no body, formula, or chip label set as large
  as (or larger than) the title. The only thing that may exceed body size is a deliberate **hero**
  element (the one big numeral or the slide-defining equation) — and even it stays below the title.
- **Hero numerals read clean** — an **integral number stays on ONE line** (no "2026" broken into
  "202"/"6" — use `wrap=False` or a wide-enough box); digits are **uniform-height & baseline-aligned**
  (a lining-figure face — Helvetica Neue / Arial / Cambria — NOT an old-style-figure face like Georgia,
  whose digits sit at different heights); and a numeral run **aligns** with adjacent CJK/Latin on its
  line (`design-principles.md` "Big numbers", `font-guidance.md`).
- **Chart axis spans every bar; a cumulative doesn't double-count** — a bar/waterfall/dot chart's
  baseline/value-axis runs under **all** its bars (not stopping short of the last one), and a
  cumulative/waterfall shows increments *or* their total, never both as peer bars (a "+8 / +8.3 /
  +16.3" trio is a double-count); keep different quantity kinds in separate stacks. Prefer
  `designed_charts.waterfall` over hand-rolled floating boxes (`design-principles.md` "Designed plots").
- **Geometry matches the number** — read one bar/band/cell's *size or colour* against its *printed
  value*: a magnitude column/bar starts at **0** (a cropped axis makes 210/220/230 read as a ~3×
  cliff); a proportional shape (funnel band, bubble) is sized to `value/max`, not clamped up by a
  min-size floor that contradicts its label; a diverging/signed scale reads its **sign** (a true 0
  is neutral, not blue). deckkit defaults handle all three — flag any hand-rolled/matplotlib chart
  that doesn't (`data-viz.md` "Chart anti-patterns", `design-principles.md` "Designed plots").
- **Formula sized to content** — every equation's glyphs read at ≈ **body size** (not blown up to fill
  the slide width, not illegibly shrunk), and **consistent across slides** (same placed height); any
  inline variable/symbol is in **math format** (italic, real sub/superscript), never plain body letters
  or Unicode super/subscripts.
- **No rule/divider crossing text** — every hairline, divider and accent bar passes BETWEEN blocks,
  never through one. The build-time `RULE_THROUGH_TEXT` gate catches this deterministically now; if you
  see one in a render it means the rule was drawn at a hand-picked `y` computed from how long the text
  happened to be at the time. Fix the *derivation*, not the coordinate.
- **Footer collision / overlap** — no block crosses into the footer band and no two stacked
  blocks overlap. If one does, the cause is almost always a hand-picked `y` for an auto-growing
  callout/stack — fix it by switching to `bottom_callout()` / `vstack()` / `content_band()`, not
  a one-off coordinate nudge (that just recurs when the text changes). **Look specifically at the
  seam where content meets a bottom callout/bar:** a *wide* bar grazing the cards above it by even
  a sliver clips their rounded corners — there must be a visible gap, so size content to the
  callout's returned top minus a `GUTTER` (reserve its space before sizing content, don't add it last).
- **Adjacent / stacked blocks — a VISIBLE gap, not a sliver** — between any two same-axis blocks
  (stacked panels, side-by-side cards, pipeline nodes) the gap must read clearly: **≥ ~0.13in
  (~⅓ `GUTTER`)**. A ~0.02in seam (three panels at pitch 1.04 with height 1.02) reads as touching —
  a gap far smaller than the slide's own margins looks cramped even though nothing overlaps. Cause:
  a hand-picked pitch that nearly equals the block height. Fix: **derive the pitch from the region** —
  `rows(n)` / `vstack(..., bottom=…)` — so the gap is set by construction, never `block_h + 0.02`.
  (The build-time lint's `SLIVER_GAP` warn catches this class deterministically — an unaddressed
  one at render time means the build-time report was skipped.)
- **Bar labels sit ON the bar** — for any track+fill row (percentile / share / progress / "want vs
  have"), the value/percent label is **vertically centered on the bar's centerline**, not floating
  above or below it, and doesn't overlap the track. Use `meter_bar()` (which centers the value by
  construction) rather than hand-placing a number at a guessed `y`.
- **Marker captions sit UNDER their marker** — on a timeline / tick row / numbered-step row, each
  caption (date · title · sub) is **horizontally co-centered with its dot/marker**, *including the
  first and last*. The classic bug: an end marker sits near the slide edge and its centered caption
  gets clamped inward, so the caption drifts off to the side of its dot. Use `timeline()` or
  `spaced_centers()` (which **inset the end markers** so every caption stays co-centered) — never
  hand-roll a dots+captions row with a per-caption edge clamp.
- **Diagrams** — arrows point the way the flow moves (down/up between stacked boxes); adjacent
  blocks have a visible gap (never touching); a lone glyph/icon optically centred (ASCII, not
  full-width, for a centred mark on a CJK deck). **A connector / loop label (e.g. a feedback-loop's
  「修订」/「retry」) sits in the OPEN GAP next to the line — offset above a horizontal segment, or beside a
  vertical one, with clearance — NOT inside an opaque chip that STANDS OUT over the line.** A chip that
  contrasts with the slide reads as a band-aid; route the label into clear space so the line and text
  simply don't collide. (On a PLAIN background a label that knocks the line OUT in the background colour —
  the line breaking cleanly for the text — is fine; the band-aid is a *visible* chip, e.g. a white block on
  a coloured/textured slide. Add a subtle *translucent* backing only if the label must cross a busy area.
  See `references/design-principles.md` → "Connector labels".)
- **Block colours** — in a sequence of chips/cards/stages, every block is a **distinct,
  deliberately-contrasted hue**: no two adjacent blocks share a colour, and **no neutral gray
  sits in the sequence as if it were a category** (use `palette()` — it warns on both). A vivid
  block beside a gray one reads as half-finished.
- **Mark-on-fill contrast — an icon glyph on its tile, a symbol/number on a coloured chip** — the
  mark must stand out from the ground it sits ON (~3:1), not just from the slide. Zoom each icon tile:
  a **same-hue pair** (teal glyph on aqua tile) or a **dark-on-dark pair** (coloured glyph on
  near-black tile) is invisible — the exact bug a mid-tone tile hides. `icon_tile` auto-guards this
  (white/near-white glyph on a deep tile, or deep glyph on a pale tile); a hand-placed icon-on-`box`
  does not, so check it here.
- **Titles** — a subtitle/definition line has a clear gap below the title's accent rule; the
  kicker/eyebrow adds a section label, it doesn't echo a word the title already leads with. **The
  title CHROME itself is not one fixed template repeated on every slide** — an identical
  eyebrow + rule-under-the-title on all ~12 content slides is a template tell (creativity is a design
  metric, not just correctness). **`lint_deck.py` now backstops the most common case deterministically —
  `TITLE-RULE MONOCULTURE` fires when the same thin rule sits under the title at the same height on
  >60% of content slides** (a `head()`-style helper that stamps one treatment deck-wide is exactly how
  this regresses); the other treatments (tab/rail/ordinal) it can't measure stay on this self-check.
  Rotate **2–3 title treatments** across the deck (e.g. a classic
  accent-rule · an eyebrow in a filled tab/pill · a left vertical accent bar · a section ordinal ·
  a motif mark) so no two adjacent slides share the exact chrome and no single treatment dominates —
  the eyebrow-ornament analogue of the skeleton-rotation floor (`references/design-intelligence-addendum.md`).
  This does **not** fight the Repetition principle: the visual SYSTEM stays constant (same palette,
  type pairing, signature motif on every slide) — you rotate the *chrome treatment*, not the identity.
  That IS "repeat the system, vary the protagonist" (`references/design-principles.md` C.R.A.P.), not a
  license to make each title look unrelated.
- **Images** — the key **subject is whole, not cropped** (`contain` vs `cover`); a generated
  image of real things is **factually right** (relative size/proportion, count, colour); any
  **labels sit under the feature** they name. A **sourced photo is aesthetically usable**, not just
  subject-correct: reject an ugly / under-construction (cranes, scaffolding) / blurry / badly-lit /
  cluttered / unrepresentative shot — re-source, or generate a **declared-stylized illustration**
  instead (a beautiful accurate illustration beats an ugly real photo; `references/image-generation.md`
  aesthetic gate + the `searched, found but low-quality → generated, flagged illustrative` rung).
- **Text over an image (hero / photo / plate)** — read the title against the pixels behind it: **(a)**
  no image **line / edge / motif / frame-ornament crosses the glyphs** (a scrim only *dims* a bright
  Deco line — it stays visible; when the image carries linework where the title lands, cover it with a
  **near-opaque panel** α ≥ 0.88, a lower-third band or corner card filled to the canvas edge, never
  bleeding off-canvas); **(b)** every run — including a gold/tint **eyebrow** — clears ≥4.5:1 against
  what's actually behind it; **(c)** an **unmistakable gap** separates the big title from its
  subtitle/rule (a subtitle hugging the title's baseline reads as an error). Fix by strengthening the
  backing, moving the text to an empty region, or re-spacing — treat a title fighting the image as a
  real defect, like an overflow.
- **PDF figures cropped precisely** — for every figure pulled from a paper, zoom **each of the four
  edges** close-up (not a glance at the whole) and confirm: (a) none of the figure's own parts is
  clipped **or flush** (flush = cut); (b) no page text bled in (its caption, a neighbour's caption
  fragment, a running head, a page number, a stray body-text line); (c) the figure is
  **self-contained — its own x/y axis labels are present**, not silently replaced by a legend you
  added on the slide. The full element list + the plot-panel-bbox pitfall (the auto-detector's box
  excludes the axis titles/ticks/legend, so an eyeballed crop near it drops them) are under **“Never
  clip the figure's OWN parts”** in Step 4. A clipped, flush, or axis-label-missing crop is a real flaw, not a nitpick.
- **Motion & images by taste** — what's there earns its place (emphasises/engages/guides),
  nothing thoughtless; what's plain is fine.
**On native Windows (PowerShell / cmd) there is no bash — call the Python entry points
directly: `python scripts\render_deck.py <deck.pptx>` and `python scripts\check_env.py`.**
The `.sh` files are just shims that forward to those `.py` scripts, so macOS / Linux /
Git Bash / WSL keep working unchanged; everything else in the toolchain is already
cross-platform Python.

**If a render fails *after* `check_env.sh` passes** (a build/LibreOffice error mid-loop),
isolate it rather than thrash: the **build script is the source of truth and re-runnable**,
so comment out the suspect slide (or the shape you last added), rebuild + re-render to
confirm the rest is fine, then fix that one slide and restore it. A frequent culprit is a
bad asset path (a figure/GIF/equation PNG that doesn't exist) or a malformed `equation_png`
string — the Python traceback names it. Don't ship a partially-rendered deck silently; if
one slide can't render, tell the user which and why. (Symptom → cause → fix tables:
`references/troubleshooting-faq.md` §5 for render failures, §3 for build tracebacks.)

**If you used animation/builds:** the render (and the critic) see only the **final
built state** — they can't play the sequence (the anim.py timing is verified to
round-trip through real PowerPoint as native builds; LibreOffice just can't *play* it).
So verify the fully-built PNG reads correctly on its own (run the loop as normal), and
in step 6 **describe the click order** to the user. Builds are a layer on a correct
static slide, never a fix for a cluttered one.

Then run the **actor-critic loop** — this is the quality engine, and the critic is a
*demanding* judge (see `agents/critic.md`), not a rubber stamp:
1. **Critique.** Dispatch an independent critic subagent through the host's available
   multi-agent/subagent tool, pointed at `agents/critic.md`, giving it the rendered PNGs, the deck's **purpose + audience**
   (plus the interview's recorded **delivery mode + density choice**, so the rubric's density carves can apply),
   `references/review-rubrics.md`, the **motion manifest** from step 4 (so it can judge the
   motion *design* it can't see in a static render), **the CONTRACT CARD** (below), **and the
   source material** (so it can
   verify claims/figures/numbers, not just style). A *separate* agent matters: it judges the
   pixels, not your intentions. It returns structured JSON — `verdict`
   ("consent"/"revise"), per-slide `findings` (severity + concrete fix), strengths, the
   `plan_audit` + `probes` blocks, and (on a full-deck consent) a one-line `ceiling`.
   **Validate the review BEFORE acting on it (the anti-skim gate's consumer side):** run
   `python3 scripts/validate_review.py critic <json>` (schema conformance), then check
   `coverage.slides_opened` lists every slide in the critic's ASSIGNED scope (whole deck for a
   sole critic; its section's range for a per-section critic), `passes` covers both lenses on a
   sole critic, `stats_block_seen: true`, and `contract_card_seen` is not false when a card was
   sent. A review failing any of these is **rejected and re-dispatched once** with the gap named —
   never acted on. Arbiter outputs validate the same way (`validate_review.py arbiter`); an
   arbiter's `escalated_unreviewed` entries are handed to the next round's fresh critic as
   candidate findings (or, at the round cap, surfaced to the user with the other open questions).

   - **Record the consent as EVIDENCE, not as a claim — add `--record <deck-dir>` to the validation
     you are already running:** `python3 scripts/validate_review.py critic <review.json> --record
     ~/Downloads/<deck>/`. It writes the `critic` block of `.deck-gates.json` **from the validated
     review itself** (verdict · blocker/major counts · the review file's path + sha256), and the
     Step-6 gate then re-reads that artifact instead of trusting a summary — a moved, edited, or
     revise-verdict review fails the hand-off. Run it on every round; `rounds` is the count of
     distinct reviews recorded, so it cannot be inflated. On a high-stakes deck, `--record` on the
     arbiter's Job-2 payload files the corroborating pass under `critic.corroborated_by`. **Why this
     is not ceremony:** a record you TYPE at hand-off is self-certification — the model that skipped
     the loop writes the same JSON as the model that ran it, so both produce identical prose and
     only an artifact tells them apart. A hand-written record still passes, and is labelled
     `SELF-REPORTED` when it does.

   - **Hand the critic the approved claim ledger WHOLE — never a summary you retyped for the
     dispatch.** A critic can only check a slide against what it was handed, so every verified
     fact compressed out of the brief comes back as a false "unsourced" finding. Measured on one
     deck: **7 of 8 such findings in a round-2 review were briefing artifacts**, and the round
     they consumed was pure waste — a larger loss than any panel-size choice. The ledger already
     exists as an artifact at Step 1; pass the artifact, not your memory of it.

   - **The CONTRACT CARD's full field list is in `references/critic-panel.md` → "The CONTRACT CARD". Assemble it from the approved plans (declarations only, never rationale) at every critic dispatch — read the field list each time rather than reconstructing it**; an external/redesign deck with no Step-1 plan states "none-declared" instead. The validation gate above rejects any review without `contract_card_seen`.

   - **When a validated review comes back, read `references/critic-panel.md` → "Handling a returned review"**: the prior round's `strengths` as a do-not-harm ledger for the actor (and the rule that they are NEVER shown to the next fresh critic), the probes-vs-plan diff and its dispositions, and how a `ceiling` line is contained.

   - **Scale the critic to the stakes — and run it as a panel** (this is the main
     speed lever):

     - **Panel sizes, lens assignments and the arbiter cross-validation pass (including the asymmetric promote/discard rule) → `references/critic-panel.md` → "Panel composition by stakes". Read it at every dispatch, before choosing the panel.**

2. **Decide.** Stop as soon as `verdict == "consent"` (the critic would present it
   as-is) — not merely when the last round's issues are fixed.
   **At ANY stakes, reaching the cap with a surviving blocker/major is never a silent ship:**
   surface the unresolved finding(s) in the Step-6 note as an honest open question — the
   low-stakes analogue of high-stakes' "fail loudly at the cap" below. Cap the rounds by
   stakes so the loop converges fast: **low-stakes ≈ up to 2 rounds, high-stakes up
   to 3.**
   **The user's `review:` tier (Step 0) is the same rule with a handle on it:** `fast` = 1 round,
   `standard` = 2, `thorough` = 3. `standard` and `thorough` are pure ALIASES for the two stakes
   classes above — same panel, same arbitration, same fresh whole-deck re-review on every round —
   so a deck whose user says nothing behaves exactly as it did before the dial existed. `fast` is
   the one genuinely new band and is 🔴 **opt-in only, never derived**. At `fast` there is no
   second round to absorb a surviving blocker/major, so it goes back to the USER named, and the
   run does not end until they answer: either they authorise one extra round (a recorded exception
   to the cap) or the ship is recorded as *their* waiver, never the model's. Tier table:
   `references/critic-panel.md` → "Review effort tiers".
   *(The cap numbers live in TWO places on purpose — here, because a cap is coordinator-enforced and
   nothing lints it, so layer 1 must carry it; and in `critic-panel.md`, which owns the rest. They
   must agree: change one, change both — the same drift hazard the distinctiveness rule carries
   below.)*
   > 🔴 **One exception to "surface it and ship": a surviving `timid` / `sanded-to-safe`
   > distinctiveness finding on a deck whose `boldness:` is `bold` or `experimental`.** There the

   in one round — don't manufacture extra rounds. Otherwise apply the blocker+major
   fixes, rebuild, re-render.
3. **Repeat.** The critic **re-reviews the whole deck fresh** (fixes introduce new
   issues). Converge; keep a short record of what changed each round so improvement is
   visible, not just churn.

**🔴 THE SEARCH BUDGET IS A SHARED, SESSION-SCOPED, NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCE — spend it like one.**
Web search is capped per SESSION (Claude Code: `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_WEB_SEARCHES_PER_SESSION`,
default 200), the cap is shared with every subagent you dispatch, and **it does not reset between
decks in the same conversation.** Measured: one research fan-out — 12 research agents plus 7
verifiers, each searching freely because nothing told them otherwise — consumed the entire 200.
Nothing metered it and nothing warned; the exhaustion surfaced hours later, on a different task,
when a single lookup for a company's official logo could not run. The deck that needed that logo
shipped without it and said so on its own limitations page. That is the shape of the failure:
**the cheap, late, small lookups starve, because the big early fan-out took everything.**

Three rules, in order of how much they buy:

1. **Do the SMALL, NAMED lookups FIRST — before any research fan-out.** The logo, the brand
   colours, a licensed photo, one specific clearance number: these are a handful of searches, they
   are the ones that get starved, and they are needed by Step 2 anyway. Front-loading them costs
   nothing and removes the failure entirely.
2. **Budget the fan-out explicitly and say the number in each dispatch.** An agent with no stated
   cap searches until satisfied, and N of them do it in parallel. Write it into the prompt —
   *"you have at most 6 searches; spend them on the claims you cannot resolve any other way"* —
   and size the round so the whole fan-out stays under roughly **half** the session cap. Half, not
   all: verification, mid-build fact-checks, and asset sourcing all still have to happen.
3. **Record what you planned and what you spent**, so exhaustion is a number someone chose rather
   than a wall someone hit. When the budget IS gone, say so in the deck's limitations and in the
   hand-off — never let a missing fact read as an absent fact.

**🔴 PRIMARY-SOURCE GATE — research-sourced decks only, before hand-off.** When the deck's
load-bearing claims came from **web research** (every no-source deck, and any sourced deck where
research supplied slide-level numbers/quotes), the content critic verifying slides *against the
ledger* is not enough — a hallucinated or secondhand ledger row passes that check by construction.
So before hand-off, run one **adversarial primary-source spot-check**: independent verifier
agent(s) with live web access take the deck's load-bearing claims (every headline number, date,
direct quote, ranking, attribution) and try to **REFUTE** each against its **primary source** (the
original paper / the org's own post / official docs — never an aggregator), returning per claim
`CONFIRMED (URL) / WRONG / PARTLY-WRONG / UNVERIFIABLE`. **WRONG and PARTLY-WRONG are fixed before
ship; UNVERIFIABLE is hedged as unverified or cut — never shipped as established fact.** While
there, verifiers also flag the planner's PROVENANCE CONTRACT breaks (spliced figures, quote-mark
abuse — `agents/content-planner.md` §2, rubric item 10). Scale it to stakes like the critic itself
(a quick deck: one verifier over the top ~10 claims; high-stakes: a fan-out over all of them) —
**and the user's `review:` tier is the handle on that same scale** — `fast` = the top ~5 load-bearing
claims, `standard` = the top ~10, `thorough` = all of them. The tier narrows the SAMPLE and never the
gate; on a research-sourced deck the gate itself runs at every tier —
but never skip it entirely on a research-sourced deck: this is the gate between "the slides match
the ledger" and "the ledger matches reality." **Ordering:** run the
verifier pass in parallel with (or immediately before) the FINAL critic round; any WRONG /
PARTLY-WRONG fix re-enters the normal rebuild → re-render → re-lint path, and a fix landing after
critic consent gets a cheap confirmation look (the touched slides, not a fresh full round) — gate
fixes never count against the critic round caps. **The gate's artifact (required, per the enforcement
invariant):** the Step-6 hand-off carries one `provenance:` line — `N claims checked · N confirmed
· N fixed · N cut/hedged` — plus the per-claim verdict list on request; a research-sourced hand-off
without that line means the gate did not run (Step 6's checklist lists it). Decks built purely from the user's own material skip
this gate — there, fidelity is to the provided source, and item 10 already owns it — **but** a
source claim that §2(b) re-verification *updated or replaced* with a web-found current value counts
as research-supplied, and pulls the gate in for those rows.

**High-stakes decks:** after each fix round's re-render, read `references/critic-panel.md` → "Verify the fixes and corroborate consent" — the arbiter re-check of the change manifest (with its required `dulled` flag) and the corroborated-consent rule that gates shipping. *(This is the "fail loudly at the cap" passage the round-cap rule above points at.)*

## Step 6 — Show the user, then iterate on feedback
Present the rendered slides (or a contact sheet) plus a short note: slides count,
purpose it was built for, and the font/portability caveat if relevant. **Tell the
user the exact output folder path (`~/Downloads/<deck-name>/`, or wherever they
chose) and ask them to open it and check the `.pptx`** — the rendered PNGs verify
layout, but they should confirm the editable deck itself opens cleanly on their
machine. **Then OFFER the two reserved deliverables rather than shipping them unasked** — a
**`.pdf`** (submission / email / print) and a **`viewer.html`** flip-through preview
(one `file://` link, any browser, any OS, no PowerPoint needed). It is zero-dependency, not
self-contained: it references the `render/` PNGs by relative path, so move the two together. They are deliberately not generated
during the build, because a deck still being edited makes them stale immediately. Ask in one line
("want a PDF and a browser preview?"); on a yes — or once the user confirms this is the final
version — run `bash scripts/render_deck.sh <deck.pptx> --deliverables` (or
`python scripts/render_deck.py … --deliverables`), which parks both at the deck root beside the
`.pptx`, and surface the two `file://` links then. **Re-run it after any later change** so the pair
never lags the deck. If you added any forward-looking content (per the fidelity rule), call that
out explicitly here so they can confirm it.

> **🔴 Run the gates on EVERY hand-off, whatever the user answers about the PDF:**

**`--deliverables` refuses to run until `<deck-dir>/.deck-gates.json` records that the Step-2
design plan, the Step-5 critic and the Step-6 provenance pass actually ran.** Write it when the
critic loop converges — `{"critic": {"verdict": "consent", "rounds": N}}`, the design plan's
`boldness` / `signature_move` / `carried_by` / `form_ledger`, and the provenance pass's **per-claim
`claims` list, never a summary tally** (a tally is written by the same pass that would have skipped
the refutation). A gate you deliberately skipped is **waived in writing** —
`{"critic": {"waived": "<reason>"}}` — never omitted; the tool prints the reason, so a skip is
visible instead of invisible. This file is the hand-off's evidence, not a formality: the model that
skips a gate is the same model that would write the note claiming it ran, so both produce identical
prose and only an artifact tells them apart (`references/handoff-checklist.md` lists it).
The `critic` block is **written by `validate_review.py --record`, not by hand** (Step 5) — you supply
only the two blocks no tool can produce for you: the design plan's four fields and the provenance
pass's per-claim list.

**Before you write the hand-off note, read `references/handoff-checklist.md` — every deck.** It is the ONE authoritative list of what the note carries (minimal caveats + next steps, never a recap or self-praise) and of the conditional REQUIRED lines the owning rules point here for: `provenance:`, **`review:`** (the effort tier that ran + how it was reached) and **`cost:`** (subagents · tokens · wall-clock — a dial whose bill is never shown builds no intuition), click order, image licences, the GIF note, accepted advisories, `distinctiveness:`, the delegated-picks recap, the optional `ceiling` line, and the two taste-ecosystem offers — **including the save-this-look offer, which is skipped entirely under a per-deck auto directive: never an un-consented registry write.**

**For a long deck (~15+ slides), show work at ~50%, not only at 100%.** When a build is large enough
that a wrong direction is expensive to unwind, render the first few finished slides (cover + a couple
of content archetypes) and check in **before** completing the rest — "here's the look and the first 3
slides; continuing in this direction unless you'd change something." Cheaper than discovering a
palette/density/structure mismatch after all 20 are built. (A soft check-in, not a 🔴 stop: under a
per-deck auto directive, post the early renders as an FYI and continue without waiting; in the
default flow, wait briefly for a reaction before finishing. Short decks: just build and run the critic.)

**Presenting, editing, and iterating after delivery — `references/handoff-checklist.md` (same file, later section).** Read it at hand-off on **any deck that carries speaker notes** (Presenter View / `export_notes.py` / how to edit without losing work), and **always** before you re-run the build on the user's feedback — it holds the reconcile-don't-clobber procedure and the required `user-dials:` round-record line.

**Step-6 close — the taste write-back (a named checklist, not prose; full protocol in
`references/user-taste.md`):**
1. **Append ONE look-history line** for the delivered deck to `taste.md` at the registry root
   (`date | deck | preset/look | canvas value | signature motif`, pruned to the 10 most recent) —
   next deck's freshness rule needs a real record to vary against.
2. **Promote a dial into `taste.md` ONLY on the recurrence gate (🔴 MUST):** the user's own words
   mark it standing ("always", "一直", "in general", "for all my decks"), **or** the same
   dimension+direction appears in the round records of **≥2 distinct decks**. One-off or
   purpose-driven corrections stay deck-scoped — a mis-promoted dial silently steers every future
   build. Every promoted row carries its verbatim quote + deck + date *(gate: invalid by schema
   without them)*; conflicting later feedback UPDATES the existing row, never appends a contradiction.
3. **Announce every write in the hand-off FYI line with the easy veto** (above) — a silent write
   didn't happen.
A brand-new user with nothing durable gets no writes and no FYI — create `taste.md` only when the
first durable signal exists.

## Anti-patterns — never do this
A checkable red-flag list; if a draft does any of these, stop and fix it before shipping:
- **Never invent** numbers, results, citations, or figures the source doesn't state (the
  one allowed exception is *flagged* forward-looking content).
- **Never skip the interview**, and **never assume** the topic/content, template, style,
  or — for a brand-new user with no footprint — a domain (ask the subject openly).
- **Never present last year's data as current** on a deck dated this year — ground to today.
- **Never leave a build/meta annotation on a slide** — "（可点击编辑的原生图表）"/"(editable native chart)",
  "(AI-generated)", "(placeholder)", "(draft)", "generated by…", TODO/FIXME. Slide text is the
  audience's content, never a note about how it was made; that goes in code comments or the hand-off.
- **Never let stacked groups blur together** — the gap between groups must beat the gap within a group.
- **Never leave a slide awkwardly empty, and never fake fullness with an oversized block** — fill space
  by **enriching the content** (add the detail/example/figure the point deserves) or enlarging the hero;
  never inflate a card/callout around a single short line of small font to cover a gap (shrink the box
  to hug its text instead).
- **Never set content text as large as (or larger than) the slide title** — body/callout/formula/label
  must be visibly smaller than the title; only a deliberate hero numeral/equation may exceed body size,
  and it still stays below the title.
- **Never oversize a formula or leave a variable in plain text** — size every equation to ≈ body text
  (consistent across slides, not blown up to fill the slide width), and set even a lone inline variable
  in math format (italic + real sub/superscript), keeping the LaTeX in the build script so it stays
  reproducible/editable.
- **Never act as your own final critic** — an independent critic must consent; **never ship
  a partially-rendered or contested-blocker deck silently** (surface the disagreement).
- **Never clobber the user's hand-edits** — reconcile before regenerating over their file.
- **Never** ship a wall-of-text slide the user didn't explicitly choose (Q4), a redrawn source figure where a real one exists, a
  cine GIF reduced to one frame, meaning carried by colour alone, or text below ~4.5:1 contrast.
- **Never** put real slide text, labels, numbers, logos, citations, source figures, or
  evidence-bearing charts inside an AI-generated image; generated images are text-free
  visual support unless the user explicitly requested a raster mockup.
- **Never** clip a figure's own parts (legend, colour bar, axis labels/ticks, outer
  row/column) with a crop or a too-large placement, and **never** chop a multi-panel figure
  into context-losing pieces when the whole figure would serve — default to the integral
  figure; **re-view every figure after cropping/placing** to confirm nothing is cut off.
- **Never** leave text in a callout / chip / takeaway bar visibly off-centre (sitting low or
  edge-hugging) — centred boxes need the textbox to span the box's true extent.
- **Never** paste Unicode super/subscripts (ᴴ ᵀ ᵣ); **never** build a "generic conference"
  deck (research the venue); **never** let the deck drift between languages.

## Files

Full inventory — every script and its flags, the agents, all reference files, the 18 `presets.py` design presets, and the template **Registry** paths — is in `references/file-inventory.md`. Read it whenever you need a capability the *Where things live* table above doesn't already route (an unfamiliar script's arguments, the preset list, which agent or reference owns a concern). Each script's own operating contract is also restated at the step that runs it, so this is a lookup, not a gate.
