"""deckkit — reusable helpers for building clean slides with python-pptx.

General-purpose: works whether you build ON a user's template (open_template) or
from scratch when they have none (blank_deck + title_bar/footer). Import this from
a small per-deck build script rather than copy-pasting primitives every time.
A brand-free worked example lives at references/examples/build_example_generic.py.

Design intent (see references/design-principles.md — these are the PRESENTED-deck defaults; a
read-alone / reference / poster deck legitimately runs denser, so flex by delivery mode):
  - terse, few-word points for a SPOKEN deck (a visual aid, not a document); a read-alone deck
    carries the fuller sentence a speaker would otherwise say
  - native diagrams (boxes + arrows) over walls of text
  - a clear title per slide; results figures always get a legend + a takeaway

The palette/fonts below are sensible DEFAULTS. When building on a template, pull
the real brand colors from it (inspect_template.py / theme) and set FONT to match;
when building from scratch, pick colors from the user's brand or pick a clean set.

Equations: NEVER rely on Unicode modifier-letter super/subscripts (ᴴ ᵀ ᵣ) — many
display fonts lack those glyphs and render tofu/overlap. Use eq_par(), which draws
real baseline-shifted ASCII in a full-coverage font, so it is crisp anywhere.

    colours each region by ``data`` on a light→``accent`` ramp, and draws a NATIVE title + gradient
    legend (so titles/units render in any language, CJK included, unlike text baked into the raster).

    ``data`` = ``{region: value}``. Keys: ISO-3166 alpha-2/alpha-3 or the English name for
    europe/world (``{"DE": 3.1, "FR": 7.3}``); the province name or adcode for china
    (``{"广东省": 100, "北京市": 95}``). Regions with no datum take the neutral ``no_data`` fill;
    unmatched keys AND non-finite/None values are reported and drawn as no-data (a blank region means
    NO DATA, not zero — check the printed notice and fix any typo/ISO before shipping).

    **Shade a RATE / share / per-capita / index — not a raw COUNT** (a total just re-draws population/
    area; big regions always go dark). ``scale='seq'`` (default, one-directional magnitude) or ``'div'``
    (signed / around a reference — the ramp is zero-centred so the neutral colour == 0, unless you pass
    explicit symmetric ``vmin``/``vmax``; ``accent2`` sets the opposite pole). ``vmin``/``vmax`` fix the
    range; ``unit`` labels the legend; ``source`` adds a caption. Requires matplotlib (already a deck
    dependency); geometry is fetched once and cached like icons. Returns the bottom y.

      shape : "circle" (disc), "squircle" (rounded square), or "square".

      grad  : a two-stop gradient tile — `(c0, c1)` or a full `[(pos,colour,alpha),…]` list —
              overriding `fill`. Gives depth a flat fill lacks (the glassy header-disc look);

              construction rather than only at render (`references/icons.md` "contrast").

    `size` is the tile edge in inches; the icon is inset by `pad` (default ≈26% so the glyph sits
    at ~50-55% of the tile — the tidy proportion). For a ROW of icons keep size/shape/treatment

        good representative still to hand the critic for a legibility judgement.
      `frame="middle"` or an int index — a specific frame.

    outer margins and equal gutters between columns — or, with ``weights=``, a **measured
    asymmetric split** with the same symmetric margins.

    Use this for any split slide — text+figure, two-up, three-up, image+caption — so the
    left and right regions (and the white margins flanking them) come out the SAME width.
    The most common lopsided-slide tell is a left panel and right panel of different
    widths, or a wider white margin on one side than the other; that happens when x/w are
    eyeballed per panel. Deriving every panel from one grid makes the layout balanced by
    construction:

        L, R = dk.columns(2, slide=s)         # two equal halves, equal flanking margins
        dk.bullet(s, *L[:3], items)           # text in the left half
        dk.picture(s, fig, *R, fit="contain") # figure in the right half (same width)

    **Pass ``slide=`` so the grid matches the deck's REAL size** — the width/height are then
    read from the presentation, so it stays symmetric on a 16:9, a widescreen 13.333×7.5, or
    a poster. Only the no-arg call falls back to the standard 10×5.625 deck; if you call it
    without ``slide=`` on a differently-sized deck, pass the same ``w_in``/``h_in`` you gave
    ``blank_deck`` (otherwise the right margin will be wrong — the very lopsidedness this
    helper exists to prevent).

    ``weights=`` (keyword-only, one positive number per column, ``len == n``) divides the
    usable span **proportionally** instead of equally — the constructive form of two rules
    that otherwise live only as prose: *"an intentional asymmetric split still keeps equal
    outer margins"* and the fix for *"don't strand a narrow element in a too-wide panel"*
    (give the narrow timeline/list a genuinely narrower column). Reach for it as a
    **remedy** when the plan states a split/rail ratio, not as decoration::

        rail, main = dk.columns(2, slide=s, weights=(1, 2))     # a 1/3–2/3 split (rail + main)
        L, R      = dk.columns(2, slide=s, weights=(1, 1.618))  # a golden split

    Margin/gap/slide-size logic is untouched, so equal outer margins are inherited by
    construction; a mis-sized ``weights`` tuple raises ``ValueError`` (like ``n < 1``).
    Default ``weights=None`` keeps today's equal split exactly.

    ``margin`` (outer left == outer right) and ``gap`` (between columns) default to
    ``GUTTER``. ``top``/``bottom`` reserve room for the title bar and footer. Returns a
    list of ``(x, y, w, h)`` tuples in inches, left to right.

    text on a light deck, 'FFFFFF' for light text on a dark panel).

    """An **EDITABLE native PowerPoint chart** (a real chart object: click to edit data/labels in
    PowerPoint, and **any non-Latin labels — CJK · Cyrillic · Greek · …** — render via PowerPoint's own
    fonts, **no tofu**, unlike the rasterised designed_charts recipes). Prefer this whenever editability
    or non-Latin labels matter. Pass ``font=`` your deck's text font for the script (e.g. your EAFONT
    for CJK; a Cyrillic/Greek deck's FONT already covers those).

    `series` = [(name, [v, v, ...]), ...]; `categories` = the x labels. Themed to the deck (palette,
    dark). `kind`: 'line' | 'line_markers' | 'column' | 'bar' — plus the **composition** kinds for a
    total AND its component mix (e.g. revenue mix across quarters): 'column_stacked' |
    'column_stacked_100' (share of 100%) | 'bar_stacked' | 'bar_stacked_100' | 'area' | 'area_stacked' |
    'area_stacked_100'. On a stacked kind each series gets its OWN palette colour — omit `highlight`
    (which greys the rest) so the mix reads; use '…_100' when the SHARE matters more than the total
    (but keep the total visible elsewhere — a 100%-stack can hide a collapsing total). Stacked/area
    kinds assume **NON-NEGATIVE, same-sign parts of ONE whole** (a negative segment crosses zero and
    the height stops meaning the total — a printed notice fires) and read cleanly to **~4–5 series**
    (more reuse palette colours and blur — group the tail into 'Other'). `highlight` = index of the
    one series to keep in the accent (others dropped to grey) — for CLUSTERED charts, not stacked. For
    a two-scale 'A↑ vs B↓' chart use `native_dual_axis` instead.

    **`zero_base=True` (default) forces a ZERO value-axis baseline for column/bar charts** so bar
    LENGTH encodes the value itself, not ``value − auto_min``. Without it PowerPoint auto-crops the
    axis on clustered-high data (scores 85/88/92, revenue 210/220/230) and a bar reading ~3× taller
    is only 1.09× larger — the classic 'cropped-axis drama' that MISREPRESENTS magnitude. It fires
    only for column/bar with all-non-negative data; line/line_markers keep auto-scale (a trend line
    legitimately wants a cropped axis). Pass ``zero_base=False`` only for a *deliberate* zoomed
    magnitude axis, and say why.

    **`emphasize=<category index>`** foregrounds ONE bar in a SINGLE-series column/bar chart (that
    bar keeps the accent, the rest drop to grey) — the per-category form of the single-highlight
    rule, since `highlight` selects a whole SERIES and so can't pick one bar on a one-series chart."""

    under the header, and a bottom rule, so it reads like a paper table. Returns the bottom
    y so the caller keeps a GUTTER below it.

    geometry first and derive centres as (x + w/2, y + h/2), then create shapes in z-order
    (node() returning the centre is a convenience, not an ordering requirement); a connector joins
    node edges/centres and must never be visible crossing a box interior.

    EDGE-DOCK BY DEFAULT: an endpoint must land ON a block's boundary, not inside it. Passing a
    block's CENTRE as `p0`/`p1` draws a line out of the block's middle — if that connector is above
    the block in z-order the line shows crossing the interior (across the block's own label). Reach
    for `connect_boxes(slide, rectA, rectB, ...)` / `hub_spokes(...)` (they compute the edge docks
    for you), or `edge_point(rect, toward)` for a single end. The build-time CONNECTOR_IN_BOX lint
    flags a centre-anchored endpoint drawn above its block. The one time a centre endpoint is OK is
    the covered pattern — connector added BEFORE the node so the node paints over the interior seam."""

    """A BEFORE→AFTER evidence board — one dumbbell row per metric, each on ITS OWN scale, with
    the collision-free geometry that otherwise needs hand-debugging (value labels above the dots,
    single-line name+sub so proximity reads correctly, per-row lo/hi so direction is honest and
    magnitude is never faked across incompatible units). The strongest form for a results /
    scoreboard slide: the GAP is the message (`form-selection.md`).

    rows = [(name, sub_or_"", v_before, v_after, scale_lo, scale_hi, unit), ...] — set lo/hi per
    row (pad ~10%); improvements where lower-is-better simply have v_after left of v_before.
    An optional **8th element** per row, ``v_mid``, draws a small neutral mid dot on the track
    (an intermediate checkpoint — e.g. an interim release between before and after) with its
    value labelled above the dot when it clears the end labels, else below the track.
    **Value labels are direction-aware and always placed OUTWARD** of the dumbbell span: a
    rightward row keeps the classic before-left / after-right geometry; a leftward
    (lower-is-better) row mirrors it, so the labels cannot collide at any span.
    `hero` = row index to emphasise (left accent bar + bold name) · `threshold` = optional
    (row_idx, value, tick_label) drawing a vertical reference tick on that row (e.g. the 100%
    line NRR must cross). **`regress`** = a set/list of row indices that got WORSE — their after-dot,
    connector, and value recolour to the risk red and the value gets a ▾ mark, so a mixed board
    doesn't paint a regression in the celebratory 'improved' accent (colour is never the only
    signal — the number and the ▾ carry it too). `label_w` defaults to the MEASURED widest row
    label (capped), so short metric names don't strand a huge empty gutter — pass it for very long
    names. Budget ~0.52in/row + margins; keep w ≥ ~8 so value labels clear. Returns the bottom y."""

    """Stephen Few's BULLET GRAPH — a compact 'actual vs TARGET, in context' KPI bar, one row per metric.
    Each row scales to its OWN maximum (KPIs carry different units, so a shared axis would crush the
    small ones — CSAT 0–5 next to Revenue 0–150), with qualitative BANDS (poor / ok / good) shaded
    behind a MEASURE bar (accent) to ``actual`` and a TARGET tick — so gap-to-goal AND 'which band it
    lands in' read as geometry, not a caption.

    ``rows = [(label, actual, target), ...]`` — or ``(label, actual, target, [b1, b2])`` with per-row
    ABSOLUTE band thresholds. Otherwise ``bands`` gives the zone edges as FRACTIONS of each row's max
    (default ``(0.6, 0.85)`` → <60% poor / 60–85% ok / >85% good); ``bands=None`` draws a plain track.
    ``higher_better=False`` reverses the band shading for 'lower is better' KPIs (churn, latency).
    Returns the bottom y. The dashboard bar ``scorecard``/``meter_bar`` can't give — those carry a
    value(+delta) but no plan line and no thresholds. Reuses ``axis_scale`` per row so the measure bar
    always fits its track. Only reach for it when each KPI has a REAL target/plan line (without one use
    ``scorecard``/``meter_bar``). Assumes non-negative actual/target; on a DARK deck pass ``band_colors``
    (light-gray defaults wash out), ``ink`` and ``target_c``. See references/data-viz.md (IBCS plan-vs-actual)."""

    """Build-time GEOMETRY self-check. Walk every shape on every slide — HOWEVER it was placed,
    manual coords or the grid/stack helpers — and report the high-signal faults that otherwise
    cost a whole visual-critic round. Reasons about each text box's INK rectangle (where glyphs
    land), so it stays quiet on the generously-sized frames real builds use:

      OFF_CANVAS   — a text box's INK, or a card/table, extends past the slide edge. Full-bleed
                     PICTURES (and giant watermark numerals) are exempt — they're meant to bleed.
      OVERFLOW     — a VISIBLE (filled/outlined) text box whose ink needs more height/width than it has.
      ESCAPES_CARD — a text box's ink / a figure / a labelled node pokes outside the FILLED card or
                     panel that encloses its centre (the "bullet ran past the bottom of its card" bug).
                     The host is the SMALLEST filled rect-panel that contains the child and is bigger
                     than it; full-bleed backgrounds and picture/outline-only cards are never hosts.
      TEXT_OVERLAP — two text boxes' INK rectangles overlap materially (real text-on-text). Text
                     layered over a fill/photo is fine and NOT flagged; faint watermark numerals
                     (>=50pt, e.g. ghost_numeral) are excluded as the decorative background they are.
      FOOTER       — a content text's ink, or a card, reaches the actual footer chrome row (keyed to
                     the real footer; a footer-less slide relies on OFF_CANVAS + the Step-5 lint_deck).
      OFFCENTER    — a card whose ONLY content is a single line of text leaves a lopsided top/bottom
                     gap (one line in a block reads best vertically centred — anchor it MIDDLE).
      SLIVER_GAP   — two panels (or a panel and a picture) NEARLY touch: their projections overlap
                     on one axis and the edge gap on the other is a sliver (0.005–0.10in — clearly
                     below the documented ~0.12in "≥ ~⅓ GUTTER" floor, so rule-compliant gaps never
                     warn). The classic cause is a hand-picked stack pitch that barely clears the
                     block height (pitch 1.04, height 1.02 → a ~0.02in seam). Flush/contained/
                     overlapping pairs (g ≤ 0) stay lint_deck.py's domain.

    Returns findings = [(slide_no, severity, code, msg)]. `verbose` prints a compact report;
    `strict=True` raises if any CRITICAL remains (headless / CI). Stays deliberately silent on what
    needs PIXELS not geometry (text on a busy image, contrast, balance, z-order, a figure smothering
    bullets) and on shapes inside GROUPS — all the visual critic's / lint_deck.py's job.

    Low false positives is the whole point (a noisy gate adds reviewer burden). The caveat: the
    wrap-dependent checks measure with the text's font, so when that font ISN'T installed and
    measurement falls back to a wider face, near-threshold flags carry ~1 line of slack and a one-time
    note is printed — i.e. every CRITICAL it prints is real WHEN the deck's fonts are available, and
    conservative (may under-flag a 1-line overrun) when they're substituted."""

# ============================================ isometric 2.5D (native — no generated image)
#
# DESIGN DECISIONS, fixed here so every 2.5D element in a deck reads as one system:
#   PROJECTION — true isometric (30 degrees), parallel not perspective. x = width -> right-and-down,
#     y = depth -> left-and-down, z = height -> straight up. Parallel projection is the right call
#     for slides: it is deterministic, tiles cleanly, and never distorts a value (a perspective bar
#     chart would foreshorten the far bars and lie about the data).
#   FACE SHADING — top = the base colour (brightest, catches the light); the right face (y=0) at
#     x0.80; the left face (x=0) at x0.55. One light source, upper-front. These three ratios are the
#     whole "3D" illusion; keep them fixed so a prism on slide 3 matches a slab on slide 9.
#   TEXT — python-pptx cannot shear text onto an isometric face, so labels sit BESIDE the geometry,
#     never on it. A value/label is placed at the shape's top-centre or to its side in flat type.
#     This is a hard limit of the medium, not a style choice; do not fake sheared text with rotation.
#   DOSE — 2.5D is eye-catching and cheap to overuse. It earns its place on a stack/hierarchy/one
#     hero chart, not on every slide (the same discipline as generated imagery). iso_bars is FAITHFUL
#     (height is linear in the value, zero-based) so it never becomes decoration that distorts data.

    element is an ACCENT index into ``accents``. ``today`` drops a vertical marker line; ``highlight``
    (a flat task index) recolours one bar. **Fails loudly** (``ValueError``) if a bar falls off the
    axis, on the ``timeline``/``vstack`` precedent.

    **VERTICAL BUDGET (size your region for it — the height is DERIVED, not fitted):** the board is
    ``header_h(≈0.5) + Σ tasks·row_h + Σ lanes·(lane_head + band pad)`` tall ≈ ``0.5 + n_tasks·row_h
    + n_lanes·0.5`` at the default ``row_h=0.42``. A 3-lane / 9-task board is ≈ 5.3in — near a full
    content band. If that overflows your slide, lower ``row_h`` (~0.34), split lanes across two
    slides, or drop a lane; there is no auto-shrink. Returns the bottom y."""
