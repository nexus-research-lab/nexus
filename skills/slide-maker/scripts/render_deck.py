    The gates that guard a deck's quality — the design plan, the independent critic, the
    primary-source spot-check — are all *self-reported prose artifacts*. The model that skipped
    them is the same model that writes the hand-off note claiming they happened, so skipping is
    invisible: the note reads identically either way. This skill's own enforcement invariant
    ranks prose last for exactly that reason (deterministic lint > required-field > checklist >
    prose), yet these three sat at the bottom of it.

    So put the check where the incentive is. `--deliverables` produces the PDF and the preview
    page — the artifacts the user actually asked for — which makes it the one step nobody skips.
    Requiring evidence *here* costs nothing on a deck that ran its loop and blocks the shortcut on
    one that didn't.

    its `sz <= 10.5 and len(t) < 40` skip had no POSITION test, so it was not a footer filter
