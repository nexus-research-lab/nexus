"""Component audit — did this deck hand-roll a form the library already implements?

WHY THIS EXISTS, measured: across three delivered decks (45 slides) the build scripts reached for
**3 of deckkit's 59 form components**. Everything else was composed from raw `box` + `text`. That is
not a style complaint — a hand-rolled form re-introduces the exact geometry bugs the component was
written to fix (a baseline hardcoded short of the last bar; a value label floating off the bar's
centerline; a segmented band whose parts do not sum; a timeline whose end caption drifts off its dot).
SKILL.md has said "when a COMPONENT exists for the form, BUILD that component" since forever — as
PROSE, with no gate. It was violated dozens of times and detected zero times.

WHY IT IS ADVISORY, NOT A BLOCKER — and this is a deliberate design decision, not timidity:
geometry alone CANNOT distinguish a lazy hand-roll from a deliberate bespoke composition, and the
deliberate one is the *signature move* — the single thing that makes a deck not-a-template. A gate
that blocked on "you hand-rolled a bar row" would delete the best page of the deck that motivated
it. So this tool reports and directs attention; it never vetoes. What it CAN state as fact is the
usage ratio and the specific component whose geometry the cluster matches.

CLI:  python component_audit.py <build_script.py> [<deck.pptx>] [--json]
Exit: 0 = nothing to report · 2 = at least one cluster matches an unused component (advisory).
